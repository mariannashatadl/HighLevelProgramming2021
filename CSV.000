Labor and delivery went pretty much how you can imagine it going. I had contractions for thirty six hours and I pushed for about two. I delivered my son at 12:45 a.m. and I was so eager to hold him and look at him. My family and I was in tears seeing this little bundle of joy come to life. I remember looking at him and wanting to provide the best I could as any parent would want for their child. \n\nMy husband took about a week and a half off for the maternity leave. It went by so fast I remember him going to work that day and I was so nervous because now I was on own. I didn't really have visitors as I'm rather introverted so everything kind of fell on me if I wanted anything done. I had unrealistic expectations having the house chores done which was the first major sign of the Postpartum Depression. I would only sleep about three hours during the night and when I woke up for feedings and I couldn't go back to sleep. After my son was fast asleep I would spend the next few hours cleaning. Everything had to be perfect but the problem was it wasn't ever good enough. I wanted to show that I had everything in control even though it wasn't like I had tons of visitors. Another sign was I had a hard time eating. At around two months I was struggling to eat at least once a day. The problem with all of this was I had so much built up energy I didn't feel tired or hungry. I just wanted to do everything all at once and keep doing these tedious, ridiculous routines. If something didn't get done I would have this anxiety attack that I wasn't being a good mom and my son deserved to have me be perfect all the time. I had a lot of trouble going outside for more then an hour because i didn't know to handle taking care of son while we were out and about. I dreaded the idea of having to feed him outside the house for some reason. I felt like a failure if i didn't read his hunger cues in time, or if he started crying. I also had these strange fears that I imagined myself dropping my son, or if I was walking down the hallway I would scrap his head on the wall or wack his head on the door frame. It was like little delusions something bad would happen.\n\nBy this time all of this stuff kind of wrapped itself into a giant mess of major depression. I wasn't the mom I wanted to be since I couldn't hold my expectations of chores and projects. I felt like I wasn't as bonded to my son as i should have been. I wasn't taking care of myself at all. \n\nI had my six week postpartum appointment at eight weeks postpartum and told my ob/gyn doctor about all of what was happening. I was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression and anxiety. I was put on birth control and a antidepressant called Lexapro. I was so hopeful this would be all that I needed and looked forward to getting everything on track. \n\nOver a few weeks it got to the point were all the stress lead me to dreading waking up or I would have meltdowns that would lead to me getting angry with my son. At this time I was crying all the time but I was ashamed to bring it up to my husband that the antidepressant wasn't working. I didn't know what to do since I no longer had Medicaid. I couldn't imagine having to get a hefty hospital bill to go back to my doctor. So once I finished the Lexapro I hoped i could handle getting better by myself. Just relax, go outside, really do anything distract myself for the depression. It didn't work as you can imagine and about a week ago I had a huge meltdown and felt like running away from all of this. I told my husband I needed help, I couldn't handle all this on my own. I needed help. I needed a break. I hated how I couldn't find joy in anything. I realized I needed to get help when my son would be crying and i would catch myself raging wanting to punch holes in the walls and screaming at my son. When I finally calmed down after the meltdown I looked at my son and realized what I was becoming. I didn't want to be this way. How could I? My son didn't deserve this. He's just a little baby and here I was being a raging nutcase. \n\nSo here we are. My mom is coming from a few states away to help me with my son. And I have a psychiatrists appointment on Monday. On Tuesday I start medication and therapy. It's been a long road so far but I've made it this far. Honestly I shouldn't waited this long to seek help but it took my a while to suck in my pride and actually do it. I'm still not healed but I can only hope for the best. Wish me luck Reddit! \n\nTl;dr: Had OCD Postpartum Depression, had unrealistic expectations that led to meltdowns, finally seeking professional help."",            ""stickied"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""postpartumdepression"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_2tfwf"",            ""thumbnail"": ""self"",            ""title"": ""Sucking in my Pride"",            ""url"": ""https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4py3vc/sucking_in_my_pride/""        },        {            ""author"": ""TegClover"",            ""author_created_utc"": 1423498434,            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""author_fullname"": ""t2_l9b19"",            ""created_utc"": 1466083095,            ""domain"": ""self.postpartumdepression"",            ""full_link"": ""https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/"",            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""4od9hu"",            ""is_self"": true,            ""locked"": false,            ""media_embed"": {},            ""num_comments"": 0,            ""over_18"": false,            ""permalink"": ""/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/"",            ""post_hint"": ""self"",            ""preview"": {                ""images"": [                    {                        ""id"": ""AzPHdvhZRXQR8wZaiyHdASf2CJSmMpoDmtNvMYDU1uM"",                        ""resolutions"": [                            {                                ""height"": 154,                                ""url"": ""https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=379dddca04416f97ff89d8f8cbda718b"",                                ""width"": 108                            }                        ],                        ""source"": {                            ""height"": 286,                            ""url"": ""https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?s=733bbe11f8d829478b31e0eb4b02cb22"",                            ""width"": 200                        },                        ""variants"": {}                    }                ]            },            ""retrieved_on"": 1472783309,            ""score"": 1,            ""secure_media_embed"": {},            ""selftext"": ""Hi all,\n\nI have been practicing a very powerful Qi Gong practice that has healed me from various ailments I once had including depression, social anxiety and low energy levels.

This used to be very different before: she changed from a high libido and happy girl, into an sad, frustrated, and asexual woman. Our son is nearly 2 years old now, and we haven't had sex for bit longer than that. We only tried 3 times, maximum, which ended in disaster twice, and once a success (until our son wanted attention). We both miss it, and I fear not having it makes everything worse for all parties, and having it back might help her tremendously too. So I would love some help.\n \nThe big question:\n \n* Do any of you have an idea of... what could be done or might be worth a shot?\n \nThanks in advance for any reply."",            ""stickied"":

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\n\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\n\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \""I'll get to it later\"" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\n\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\n\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\n\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

My wife and I just had twin boys, and two months in I am more miserable and angry and frustrated than I've ever been in my life, and I've never been a really happy person. I go to sleep at 8pm, get up at 2am, and it feels like a nightmare from the minute I get out of bed until the minute I fall asleep, if I sleep at all. Just hearing a sound out of either kid sets my teeth on edge, I find myself consumed with such an unreasonable hatred that it scares me. I completely understand that they're babies, have no control over their world, no way to communicate other than crying. Logically, everything they do makes perfect sense, the reflux, the gagging, the gas, the crying, the sleep issues. But I cant change the waves of rage and frustration that I feel like are constantly eroding my sanity. My wife is blissfully happy, so I'm trying to let her get out, let her hold on to that happiness, so at least one of us is sane. When I leave the house, I'm just consumed with regret and thoughts of how life was before these two showed up. Of all the things I've willingly given up, nothing is pleasurable anymore. I've worked on the water for years, always loved the beach and the ocean, and now it just pisses me off to be there and know that I had it, right there, and I gave it up for the nightmare my life feels like now. If anyone knows of a support group out there for fathers in similar situations, or anywhere i can vent and just know that I'm not the only one, that I'm not crazy or a bad person, please let me know.

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\n\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\n\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \""I'll get to it later\"" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\n\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\n\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\n\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\n\n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \""zombie,\"" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.\n\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.\n\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\n\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).\n\nI'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again.

The only way I got help was from a questionnaire I filled out at the doctors office because I got severely ill.\n\nI told the piece of paper how I was feeling. How sad is that?\n\nFrom there, I got rooted over to my OB for the psych evaluation. It was not bad but I was done. The only thing that was prescribed to me was sleep.\n\nWhat?! Yes, sleep. I was extremely sleep deprived. \n\nBut what mom isn't? \n\nI was to sleep for 4 days straight. No baby, no pumping... nothing. My mom and friend had to take shifts to feed my little one. I was to report to my OB how I was feeling daily. Also I was on the brink of crazy dehydration. Drink water mommies!\n\nAfter all was said and done, that \""feeling\"" went away. I found support reading other womens stories and just talking about it. When reading other stories, it helps to facilitate your healing and your family.\n\nI was also able to be honored to write monthly for Postpartum Support International blog.

Even when I feel hungry, nothing sounds good to eat. It all repulses me. \nAlso when I breastfeed her, t makes me nauseous too. Like, emotionally nauseous if that makes sense. \nAlso, the whole sleep when the baby sleeps advice just doesn't make sense. I mean, sure after nights when she is fussy or keeps me up all night, and I need to catch up on sleep, but like last night, she slept for 2 to 3 hour stretches and hubby and I took turns feeding her so we only had to wake up 3 to 4 times during the night. I mean, newborns sleep like 14 hours a day and I couldn't sleep that much of I wanted to, nor do I think that's healthy. I need other folks advice. Thanks in advance. I have a wonderful, loving, supportive husband. He doesn't know how to console me when I get sad, because There is never a real trigger for the crying, just I suddenly can't stop the years at times.

I want to make sure to note that neither me nor my son are ever a part of these thoughts- they seem to just come into my head with little explanation. \n\nI don't even know what brings up these thoughts, and it scares me that i can't seem to shut them off. I don't have any other symptoms that I can think of. \n\nI plan on talking to my OB-GYN this week- but I thought I'd post to see if I could get an idea as to what to expect. I have never been diagnosed with depression before, so I'm unfamiliar with the process. Do I just tell him what I've posted here? Will he prescribe something right away? I'm still breastfeeding and would like to continue- is that possible? \n\nThanks in advance for your help.

If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\n\n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \""zombie,\"" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.\n\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.\n\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\n\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).\n\nI'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again.

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\n\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\n\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \""I'll get to it later\"" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\n\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\n\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\n\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\n\n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \""zombie,\"" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.\n\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.\n\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\n\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).\n\nI'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again.

I really want to get back into a routine, but I'm just lost. I feel fairly good in terms of my pregnancy, but I miss the pride and confidence I got when I was working out. \n\nAny tips for routines on getting back on track? \n\nEdit: I also wanted to throw out that I used to really love running. I initially lost 40 pounds running alone, and I loved it.

I'm futurecompanion11 and I'm 21 weeks pregnant with my first, a baby girl. \n\nFirstly, before my pregnancy I was fairly active and ate a semi-low carb diet. I was running fairly regularly. Then I got pregnant, then I got HG. Hyperemesis Gravidarum made me sick and practically bed ridden for 12/13 weeks. I was barely able to eat any vegetables until 19 weeks along. \n\nBy 8 weeks along I had lost a few pounds. But then I ate away part of the nausea with sugary/carby foods. It was all I could keep down and sugary drinks especially helped curb the nausea. So I started gaining weight. I've gained 20 pounds from my starting weight and I'm not really too happy about it. \n\nAt 20 weeks I started really feeling better so I tried to start eating better and even started swimming and walking/jogging. Jogging or running is pretty hard on me right now. I've lost a lot of muscle by laying in bed for weeks. Swimming has been great but since I've been back at work the pool closes at 5 and I don't have time to get there (next week it will be open until 8 though). \n\nThe thing is is sometimes I still struggle with nausea in the mornings and the only thing that really helps it is easily digested carbs and I know that it's putting the weight on me. I can't let my stomach get anywhere near empty or the nausea/heartburn turns really bad. Once I get going during the day I can usually manage to eat healthier but the mornings are rough on me. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for advice. Do I just fight the morning and try to eat a protein breakfast to get myself going through the day? Should I jump into eating healthy and risk feeling sick? Or should I just keep doing what I'm doing, gain too much weight, and deal with it after the pregnancy is over?  Has anyone else on here been through HG and then want to get fit again mid pregnancy?

I was training for a spring marathon (first one!) but due to preggo status the marathon is out. I have a few questions and a complaint:\n\n\n1) will my energy return soon? Why am I so slow now? \nMy pace has gone from 5:15 Kms to 7min Kms!!! (that's 8:15 to 11 min plus for you yanks) \n\nI'm 10w today and I'm fucking exhausted after a 12 k run. I used to bust at least 18-25 km on Sundays, and had no problem maintaining 50-60km weeks. That feels impossible now. I'm hoping after 12 weeks I can start creeping my mileage back up a bit more. \n\n\n2) Im registered for a 1/2 marathon on March 4. Considering my current sad mileage I'm considering a walk/run strategy.  Not to race just to complete the distance. Is this a bad idea. \n\n\n3) I'm registered for a 30k race early April   Also plan to walk run depending on feeling. Is this a bad idea ? These races were booked as marathon prep before I was with child. \n\n\nI understand you are supposed to play it by ear and not do anything that feels wrong or hurts. But running is the only joy I had and now it's gone. Now it sucks and is a slog and I fucking miss it so bad. Oh boo hoo for me. Maybe I should just get in the pool already for my cardio.

You all inspire me and motivate me on a daily basis, so I figured it might be time for me to contribute to this fabulous community.\n\nAs someone who didn't work out....well, at all....during her first pregnancy, I decided to make the commitment to keep up exercising after I found out that I was pregnant with my second.  I am so glad that I did!  While the physical benefits have been great, I have also found that the psychological benefits are beyond reproach.  Even with a 2-year-old and an even crazier schedule than in my first pregnancy, I feel much more even-keeled emotionally.  It is GREAT. :)\n\nAll of this pregnant-exercisey goodness has lead me to researching fitness during pregnancy quite a bit.  I figured some of you ladies might find some of these links/articles interesting! I tried to limit the studies that I posted here to research done in the last five years.  Sadly, there needs to be a LOT more research done on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, because (as many of these articles notes) cultural perceptions of exercising during pregnancy are only recently starting to shift toward the positive end of the spectrum.\n\n\n[American College of Sports Medicine Current Comment: Exercise During Pregnancy](https://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/exerciseduringpregnancy.pdf)  A nice summary of the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, that it is actually *recommended* by both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and that women may absolutely continue with current exercise regimens OR begin new ones while pregnant.\n\n[American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable Consensus Statement: Impact of Physical Activity during Pregnancy and Postpartum on Chronic Disease Risk](https://www.acsm.org/docs/publications/Impact%20of%20Physical%20Activity%20during%20Pregnancy%20and%20Postpartum%20on%20Chronic%20Disease%20Risk.pdf?sfvrsn=0) This one was really cool- exercise during pregnancy may actually reduce the risk of preeclampsia, other hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, joint and musculoskeletal pain, and depression in pregnant women. This article also includes a section on the effect of exercise on lactation that was well-substantiated- basically exercise has absolutely no effect on lactation; women who exercise produce just as much boob-juice as women who don't, and the compositions of said milk is exactly the same. (One study did note that \""exhaustive exercise\"" at \""maximum intensity\"" decreased certain immunological components of breast milk, though.  But only for about an hour after said exhaustive exercise, then the components of the breast milk return back to normal. AH, the human body is so cool!)  My favorite quote from this article (as a lady who loves to lift heavy and has continued to do so during this pregnancy): \""fetuses of women who continue vigorous weightbearing exercise until onset of labor have normal amniotic\nfluid erythropoietin levels, fewer worrisome fetal heart\npatterns during labor, and decreased rates of both meconium\nstaining and cord entanglement at birth.\"" Yesssss.\n\n[Post-Partum Exercise: What You Need to Know](http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2014/january/post-partum-exercise-what-you-need-to-know)  This shorty-short little article provided a totally healthy (and do-able!) post-partum exercise schedule based on the age-old \""9 months to put it on, 9 months to take it off\"" idiom: \""Months 1 - 3: Emphasis should be on staying healthy and getting back into a routine. Months 4 - 6: Begin concentrating on light weight training and cardio.  Months 7 - 9: Rebuilding strength, and higher intensity cardio.\""\n\n\n[Exercise in Pregnancy: Effect on Fitness and Obstetric Outcomes\u2014A Randomized Trial](http://bradleypricemd.com/documents/exercise_in_pregnancy.pdf)  This article was published in 2012 and documents the effect of perinatal exercise on women both during and after pregnancy. Highlights from this study: only about 16% of pregnant women exercise the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology-recommended 30 minutes per day.  Not many obstetricians discuss exercise with their patients, and because data on fitness and pregnancy is relatively limited, not many docs in obstetrics programs even receive information on perinatal exercise in school (EEP!!!). Not a single woman who was part of the \""exercise\"" group in this study developed gestational diabetes.  The lengths of pregnancy and labor in the exercise and non-exercise groups were almost exactly the same, though 87% of women in the exercise group gave birth vaginally, compared to 61% in the sedentary group.  Eight control subjects opted out to exercise rather than to continue in the sedentary group (yaaasss). Placenta weight was slightly higher in the active group, consistent with evidence that exercise augments placental growth during early and mid pregnancy. Aaaaand the last sentence of the paper: **\""The data are strong enough to suggest that every practicing obstetrician would be wise to provide each newly pregnant woman a prescription for exercise in pregnancy.\""**\n\n[Maternal fitness at the onset of the second trimester of pregnancy: correlates and relationship with infant birth weight](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2047-6310.2012.00129.x/abstract;jsessionid=CAAF08AC388993F57439D6B57D241B2A.f01t04?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) Published in 2013: \""A positive relationship between maternal muscular fitness and infant birth weight highlighted maternal strength in pregnancy as a new determinant of infant birth weight.\"" Basically, a fit mama tends to result in a higher birth weight in the baby.\n\n[Core Training Exercise Selection During Pregnancy](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2012/02000/Core_Training_Exercise_Selection_During_Pregnancy.9.aspx)  Published in 2012 by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. It killed me that I would have to buy this damn article to read anything but the abstract...I love where it is headed though: \""Abdominal core and muscular conditioning is seldom recommended for pregnant populations. A literature review clearly indicates support from the medical field for the application of core muscular training during pregnancy to help alleviate many issues associated with pregnancy.  Specific core exercises are described to aid in the implementation of safe and effective training during pregnancy.\"" WHAT ARE THEY I WANT TO KNOW\n\n[Perceptions of effective advice in pregnancy \u2013 The case of activity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136190040500021X)  Again, this looks SO interesting, but $$$ to read the entire thing. Grr. \""The paper highlights the inherent difficulties of providing effective advice during the short period of pregnancy; the need for clear and consistent messages to be provided by all health professionals involved in antenatal care as well as the difficulty of changing cultural expectations of pregnancy-appropriate behaviours.\""\n\n[The effect of maternal exercise during pregnancy on abnormal fetal growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760660/) Published in 2013.  \""The beneficial effect of maternal physical activity on fetal growth may be caused the impact of aerobic exercise on glucose tolerance. Fitness trainers and kinesiologists, as well as health care providers, should be educated on the benefits of regular exercise during pregnancy and safe physical exercise for pregnant women.\""\n\n\nThat's all for now! So if anyone criticizes you and your exercising pregnant bad-self, just show 'em some of these articles. ;) Keep on keepin' on, ladies!

I went on a couple of short walks on \""good\"" days but I've been feeling too crummy otherwise to work out regularly.\n\nMy mom and I are going to Utah and the Grand Canyon the first week of July and I'd really like to hike again.\n\n**My questions are:** \n\n**Is hiking a bad idea at 17/18 weeks when I've lost so much fitness?**\n\n**Do I have time to get any sort of semblance of cardio endurance back in 3 weeks (now that I'm starting to feel better)?** \n\n**Any other tips about hiking in a hot desert climate while pregnant?**"",            ""stickied"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""fitpregnancy"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_372t2"",            ""thumbnail"": ""self"",            ""title"": ""Hiking in Utah in three weeks, when I'll be at 17 weeks.

The problem is I don't feel like I have the energy, strength, or even the ability to work out. What do you do when you don't feel like you can work out due to sickness and lack of energy?
