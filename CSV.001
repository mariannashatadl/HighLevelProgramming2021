My son was born 2 1/ months early and I lost my first son 6 months into the pregnancy so our life together started out more stressful than most. I can honestly say that going through post partum was almost as bad as what I went through losing my baby. Here I had this perfect little boy who survived prematurity and I wasn't happy, I felt locked inside myself, I couldn't bond and I couldn't talk to anyone because what would they say- \""be happy you finally have a son...\"" I remember feeling that he deserved so much more, that they would be better off without me. I thought about how peaceful it would be if I drove the 9 hours to Seattle and just kept driving off the pier into the bay, how still the water around me would be and then they wouldn't have to deal with me shut down, irritable, tired. I never thought about hurting him, I thought about chopping down the ponderosa pines in my yard with my hands, I thought about how great it would be if fairy godmothers were real and I could call one, I thought my dead son would be ashamed that I wasn't a vision of smiling maternal bliss like the women in commercials. \n He had colic for 3 months and every night he would cry for hours, the sound was like nails on a chalkboard inside me and I thought he was expressing what wasn't ok for me to express. I couldn't deal with it, I had no family support or any real support from friends, my ex husband would be gone at work all day and I would be home alone trying so hard to feel the joy that I wanted to feel and hating myself every second that I didn't. It wasn't until Brooke Shields appeared on Oprah to talk about her experiences and her book that I understood what I was going through. He was 2 and napping and tears just started pouring down my face, all I could think was that I wasn't bad, it wasn't my fault that all my chemicals were so fucked up, and being able to separate myself from my condition lifted that fog, I felt liberated and now I'm ok. \n  It makes me really mad that professionals know how common this and how it can come to a devastating end but since it's a \""woman's issue\"" no effort is meant to be pro active and preventative about it. No one sits down and explains it to you before it happens, no one checks up on you, when you tell people you feel like a bad mom and you're irritable and you think you made a mistake they say \""you don't mean it, your'e tired\"" . You have to deal with your husband complaining that you're negative and lazy and you should just cheer up....  it's so wrong and unnecessary.

A large proportion of healthy people can have them to an extent as well, but there is a point where they become too real/disturbing/disruptive to be normal. Intrusive obsessional thoughts were a major feature of my postpartum anxiety/depression. They slowly evolved and eventually featured me doing very violent, gruesome things to my son, to the point that I could *feel* myself doing those things (Not saying that yours would get so bad!). That made it hard to talk about, but I went to my psychologist and got referred to a psychiatrist, and I am much better now.\n\nAs for what you do: definitely bring up everything that is bothering you to your primary doctor/care provider. If that is your OB/Gyn, that's ok, but if you have a family doctor, I'd go to them instead. Really, go to the person that you feel the most comfortable with talking to this about. After telling your doctor all of your issues/symptoms and life context, the doctor can prescribe medication right away if they feel it is warranted, but my preference would be (if time allows) for you to talk to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist. They are better trained to dissect exactly what is going on in your mind, which makes them better at picking specific antidepressants/anti anxiety medication for your specific issues (if necessary). It will take several weeks to start seeing results with medications (although side effects can start right away, like I had a headache for a week, but it went away). There are multiple medications that are considered safe for breastfeeding, I am on two of them (Wellbutrin and Cipralex). I saw no difference in my son from any passive uptake of the medication into my milk. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my second and they are also generally considered safe for pregnancy (Cat C). I am weaning off now as I have completed my treatment cycle.\n\nTalk therapy has also been very helpful for me, and I strongly recommend it. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I had been seeing the psychologist for a few years before I had my son, as I had pre-existing issues and the cognitive-behavioral therapy was very helpful in those, and the issues related to postpartum anxiety/depression. I'd recommend looking into some form of therapy whether or not you go forward with medication, as it can help you in other ways, such as figuring out the sources of these thoughts, identifying other symptoms you didn't realize you had, and other stresses in your life that you might not realize you are not coping well with."",            ""controversiality"": 0,            ""created_utc"": 1427729644,            ""distinguished"": null,            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""cpvl75t"",            ""link_id"": ""t3_30rooj"",            ""nest_level"": 1,            ""parent_id"": ""t3_30rooj"",            ""reply_delay"": 44328,            ""retrieved_on"": 1432097627,            ""score"": 3,            ""score_hidden"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""Postpartum_Depression"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_31ndt""        },        {            ""author"": ""BadgerMama"",            ""author_created_utc"": 1423016342,            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""author_fullname"": ""t2_l55ar"",            ""body"": ""Oh my goodness, no wonder you are having issues.

Are you breastfeeding? I ask because I didn't get PPD with my firstborn, BUT when he weaned, I got hit with some major depression issues...suicidal thoughts, etc. It was pure yuck. Since you are going back to work and have so much on your plate, just wanted to toss that warning your way. There is no end to the hormonal s***storm that postpartum moms get to deal with. \n\nNow, that being said, BIG props to you for doing the basics. You are drowning in some deep waters and you still manage to feed, change, clothe and feed the baby. That is HUGE. GOOD MAMA. And good for you for reaching out to get help. I know it isn't easy, and sometimes it feels like when you do ask for help, your voice is not really heard or understood. Keep going. Just keep on, I know it feels like you are hanging on by a thread, but yes -- go get that medicine now! My primary care physician hooked me up and gave me a referral to someone who is currently managing my meds. (I ended up finding my best-ever therapist in the same practice as Medicine Woman, so yay for that.) It took me several tries to find the right therapist, too, and I think that I wasted a bit too much time sticking with the ones that didn't work out. (Story of my life.) When I met my current therapist, we clicked, and it just... worked, in a way it had not before. Of course, it helped that she was actually trained and had real degrees in this stuff. \n\nBefore her, I saw a \""therapist\"" with a doctorate in philosophy first. Useless bugger. Then I saw a woman who was with a therapy practice, but she herself was not a fully trained and licensed psychiatrist, just a \""therapist.\"" What was the difference? In my case, the two \""misses\"" both saw me for months without once figuring out that the symptoms that I was complaining about might be indicative of PPD. With the second one, I actually got on the medication while in therapy with her, and she kept forgetting I was on the medication, and when I reminded her of it, she was always a bit confused and dismissive, as if it could not have possibly been a problem with my brain chemistry. \n\nThe third one knew exactly what I was talking about with the PPD stuff. She LISTENED to me, made me feel like I was being heard and understood, and seemed like she was fully supportive of me as an individual. Like she really saw me for who I was and wanted me to thrive. I truly hope you find someone who is like that for you. Now, please, get some sleep if you can (I know it can be so hard to come by, but I hope you can!) and promise you will make it a big priority to talk to a doctor about getting that medication. \n\nIs there any way you can talk to a school counselor about your situation? You may have some options there. With an 8-month-old, you are in THE roughest stretch, and even being able to put school on hold until fall will make a huge difference. Do you have *any* support at all?\n\n(Sorry for the TL:dr, I did not know I was going to write a novel!)"",            ""controversiality"": 0,            ""created_utc"": 1426465973,            ""distinguished"": null,            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""cpg3f8t"",            ""link_id"": ""t3_2yrf8s"",            ""nest_level"": 3,            ""parent_id"": ""t1_cpg0bzl"",            ""reply_delay"": 5932,            ""retrieved_on"": 1427782408,            ""score"": 1,            ""score_hidden"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""Postpartum_Depression"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_31ndt""        },        {            ""author"": ""BadgerMama"",            ""author_created_utc"": 1423016342,            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""author_fullname"": ""t2_l55ar"",            ""body"": ""(Background: I am 40, have had depression issues my whole life, but I completely fell apart when my second child was born in 2011.

I tried everything I could and went undiagnosed and untreated and unhappy and scared for 18 months. The day I found out I had PPD and that I could be treated, I cried with relief. I had reached the point where each day I struggled to decide if my children would be better off without me. If this would be the day that I either killed myself or ran away. (And yes, it was precisely in that order.) The baby was safe, but my oldest was 3 at the time, and there were times I would shut him in the bathroom and order him not to come out (while I hit/threw/broke things) just so I could be sure I wouldn't hurt him.\n\nZoloft was a miracle. The very first day I started, I could feel a difference. (Your mileage may vary.) I am also seeing a therapist. There are still days when I feel the depression creeping back. There are still days when I get angry. But I no longer feel like my depression is a monster that is controlling me. I feel like I have the power to make choices now, and that is a HUGE difference.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have much help for you. My therapist has told me of some women who (for one reason or other) cannot take any medication, and they made it through a combination of daily meditation, daily exercise, regular talk-therapy, etc. I don't know if that will help you, but if you can manage it and haven't tried already, it may be worth a shot. Also, one thing I have noticed is that if I do not get enough sleep, all of my PPD symptoms get out of control really fast, even with the medication. So now I am trying to be much much better about getting enough sleep.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can't breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can't breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give. I guess this is my intro for now. I look forward to some redditt support as I try and sort this out.
