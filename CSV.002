I'm 29 weeks now and I've been making slight modifications to each lift based on how I felt each week. \n\nMore details below, but huge +1 to listening to your body. :) \n\nI felt great during my first trimester so I kept doing everything the way I would have pre-pregnancy, I did up my weight or reps but I didn't go down much. Maybe one or two workouts I felt too tired to do my usual routine so on those days I would do a warm up, recognize that I felt tired and call it a day. Always keeping in mind that I would try again the next workout. \n\nAround 16 weeks bench press got uncomfortable so I started doing it with my feet up on the bench. I move less weight this way but I like being able to keep benching.  I do incline sometimes too and that feels OK. \n\nFor squats, I started doing maybe 85-90% my usual weight in the third trimester and paid close attention to how my joints felt and to my form.  Around 16 weeks I started using a Smith machine for squats. I take a wider stance now and the machine makes adjusting my form each week much easier. It also helps me cope with my changing center of gravity.\n\nUntil last week I was doing deadlifts at about 80-85%. My stomach is finally big enough that my usual form just doesn't work (I can't squat deep enough to grab the bar without widening my stance). So I decided no more deadlifts for now. I'm kinda bummed about that but then happy that I was able to do them for this long. \n"",            ""controversiality"": 0,            ""created_utc"": 1468646359,            ""distinguished"": null,            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""d5e9lfc"",            ""link_id"": ""t3_4rwqsw"",            ""nest_level"": 1,            ""parent_id"": ""t3_4rwqsw"",            ""reply_delay"": 636909,            ""retrieved_on"": 1471463514,            ""score"": 1,            ""stickied"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""fitpregnancy"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_372t2""        },        {            ""author"": ""chefymum"",            ""author_created_utc"": 1409620146,            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""author_fullname"": ""t2_i6d8d"",            ""body"": ""Everyone is different so there are no hard and fast rules.

I built up from 2-3 mile repeats to a 6 miler between weeks 3-9, and now (25 weeks tomorrow) I stay around 4 mile runs because there's a lot of discomfort with my bladder and it's now pretty hot here. I got to yoga maybe 3 times in the first trimester but have been going at least once a week since then.

I took the entire first trimester off. I was exhausted.\n\nI started running again in the second trimester. It was hard to run a mile. I would go out for a 5k, but it would be run/walk. At first. Within a week, my endurance was coming back and I was able to run the entire 5k. Within a few weeks, I was running 6-10 miles each time I went out.\n\nI'm 31 weeks tomorrow and haven't run for almost three weeks now. Around 26 or 27 weeks, running got much more difficult.

But I'm really glad I kept at it during the second trimester - I felt great.\n\nI did gain 15 pounds during the second trimester, which felt like a lot (total by the end of second trimester was up 20.6 pounds, which is more than I've gained in my prior two pregnancies).

Belly was up almost ten inches (around), butt was 0-1 inches (my measurement for 15 weeks is the same as my measurement for 27 weeks, but 15 weeks was 1 inch more than 14 weeks), and thigh was up .25-1 inch (goes up and down)."",            ""controversiality"": 0,            ""created_utc"": 1461934667,            ""distinguished"": null,            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""d2lzyi0"",            ""link_id"": ""t3_4gqiyf"",            ""nest_level"": 1,            ""parent_id"": ""t3_4gqiyf"",            ""reply_delay"": 144682,            ""retrieved_on"": 1463771311,            ""score"": 1,            ""stickied"": false,            ""subreddit"": ""fitpregnancy"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_372t2""        },        {            ""author"": ""virtuesplea"",            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""body"": ""I started getting foot pain around that point.

I've been scaling back weights and intensity since I found out, at about 6w.  I just go by feel.  If you're working with a coach, definitely let them know.  Number one thing is to check with your doctor and make sure you're cleared to get back in the gym, since you were on bedrest!!\n\nWhen you do start back, remember that your workouts are no longer for time or for PRs.  No running/rowing time trials, no max lifts, no trying to beat benchmarks.  It does not matter what anyone else is doing, don't let yourself compete against them (this is really hard for me, as I was competitive in CF pre-pg).  Stay hydrated, keep intensity moderate (you should be able to hold a conversation), and scale weights as you feel you're able.  I'm typically working off about 80% of my pre-pregnancy maxes now, at 15w, but every day is different - some days lifting feels terrible, some days it almost feels normal.\n\nAdditionally, I stopped doing bar muscle-ups (sad face! I love those!) and GHD work as soon as I found out.  I'm now finding that some other things involving hollow body position (hollow holds, ring muscle-ups, kipping pullups) often don't feel good due to the round ligament pain I have, so if it hurts that day I find a substitute movement for the WOD.  I will probably stop situps and bench press in about another month or so (around 20w), and start doing cleans/snatches from the hang instead of from the ground.  I still do everything else.  I was a gymnast, so inverted movements for me personally are still safe; however, if I ever feel like my balance is compromised, I will stop those as well.  Some days I choose intermediate-level WODs instead of Rx-level like I'm used to, just depends on how I'm feeling.  As bad as it sounds, this is really humbling for me, more than anything - I have to set my Crossfitter's ego aside for the year! LOL\n\nOne last thing.  As long as you're medically cleared and you're working out safely (keeping the above things in mind), don't let other people tell you that you shouldn't be Crossfitting while pregnant!  There is no better time to stay in shape, doing the things your body is used to doing.  I've had to field that concern already from multiple people (well-meaning, but misguided), and it's aggravating to me that people think Crossfit is suddenly dangerous when a women is pregnant! \n\nThe Crossfit Mom blog is no longer around, but their poster can be found here http://crossfitcaveman.com/crossfit-during-pregnancy/ with super helpful info on scaling.

It is okay to not gain weight in your first trimester. You aren't supposed to increase calorie consumption yet as the baby is so small it doesn't require the additional calories. If you are of a healthy weight and habits, now is a good time to calculate your caloric needs and make it a goal to maintain those for the first trimester. Before the naysayers jump in, it is okay to gain 3-5lbs in the first tri.

Yes, they'll be high carb, but getting something down is important and I suspect keeping milk, juices, etc around will be easier than taking the time to prepare whole meals. Even when you're not hungry, maybe you can sneak in some calories that way."",            ""controversiality"": 0,            ""created_utc"": 1445007709,            ""distinguished"": null,            ""gilded"": 0,            ""id"": ""cw1vzu3"",            ""link_id"": ""t3_3ozodm"",            ""nest_level"": 1,            ""parent_id"": ""t3_3ozodm"",            ""reply_delay"": 3711,            ""retrieved_on"": 1447006628,            ""score"": 8,            ""subreddit"": ""fitpregnancy"",            ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_372t2""        },        {            ""author"": ""auryngem"",            ""author_created_utc"": 1338187906,            ""author_flair_css_class"": null,            ""author_flair_text"": null,            ""author_fullname"": ""t2_7tuip"",            ""body"": ""Thanks for your thoughts. Am am still lifting and prd some deadlifts last week 110kg and my front squats, when I think about it it was probably on implantation day. This makes me feel a little better. It's  not so much getting back into it that I'm worried about; I just don't want to find myself backing off. Lifting is what keeps me mentally and physically fit. I was told by my OB last pregnancy I am high risk for post and ante natal depression - if lifting goes I worry this will be inevitable. He suggested then seeing someone while I was well, I just didn't quite make it to that point. I will make sure to do so this time. It's good to hear from someone who has been/is in my position and is making it work. Your reassurance means a lot.
