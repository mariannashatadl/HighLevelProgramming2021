As a first time mom learning the ropes of parenting has been a tough endeavor that I couldn\\'t even imagine during pregnancy. It\\'s hard to imagine something so beautiful in its own right can lead to something that made me recognize my limits, and reveal something underlining that lead to me getting treatment for Postpartum Depression. \\\\n\\\\nBack story: After a rather difficult pregnancy my son was born on March 4th. Labor and delivery went pretty much how you can imagine it going. I had contractions for thirty six hours and I pushed for about two. I delivered my son at 12:45 a.m. and I was so eager to hold him and look at him. My family and I was in tears seeing this little bundle of joy come to life. I remember looking at him and wanting to provide the best I could as any parent would want for their child. \\\\n\\\\nMy husband took about a week and a half off for the maternity leave. It went by so fast I remember him going to work that day and I was so nervous because now I was on own. I didn\\'t really have visitors as I\\'m rather introverted so everything kind of fell on me if I wanted anything done. I had unrealistic expectations having the house chores done which was the first major sign of the Postpartum Depression. I would only sleep about three hours during the night and when I woke up for feedings and I couldn\\'t go back to sleep. After my son was fast asleep I would spend the next few hours cleaning. Everything had to be perfect but the problem was it wasn\\'t ever good enough. I wanted to show that I had everything in control even though it wasn\\'t like I had tons of visitors. Another sign was I had a hard time eating. At around two months I was struggling to eat at least once a day. The problem with all of this was I had so much built up energy I didn\\'t feel tired or hungry. I just wanted to do everything all at once and keep doing these tedious, ridiculous routines. If something didn\\'t get done I would have this anxiety attack that I wasn\\'t being a good mom and my son deserved to have me be perfect all the time. I had a lot of trouble going outside for more then an hour because i didn\\'t know to handle taking care of son while we were out and about. I dreaded the idea of having to feed him outside the house for some reason. I felt like a failure if i didn\\'t read his hunger cues in time, or if he started crying. I also had these strange fears that I imagined myself dropping my son, or if I was walking down the hallway I would scrap his head on the wall or wack his head on the door frame. It was like little delusions something bad would happen.\\\\n\\\\nBy this time all of this stuff kind of wrapped itself into a giant mess of major depression. I wasn\\'t the mom I wanted to be since I couldn\\'t hold my expectations of chores and projects. I felt like I wasn\\'t as bonded to my son as i should have been. I wasn\\'t taking care of myself at all. \\\\n\\\\nI had my six week postpartum appointment at eight weeks postpartum and told my ob/gyn doctor about all of what was happening. I was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression and anxiety. I was put on birth control and a antidepressant called Lexapro. I was so hopeful this would be all that I needed and looked forward to getting everything on track. \\\\n\\\\nOver a few weeks it got to the point were all the stress lead me to dreading waking up or I would have meltdowns that would lead to me getting angry with my son. At this time I was crying all the time but I was ashamed to bring it up to my husband that the antidepressant wasn\\'t working. I didn\\'t know what to do since I no longer had Medicaid. I couldn\\'t imagine having to get a hefty hospital bill to go back to my doctor. So once I finished the Lexapro I hoped i could handle getting better by myself. Just relax, go outside, really do anything distract myself for the depression. It didn\\'t work as you can imagine and about a week ago I had a huge meltdown and felt like running away from all of this. I told my husband I needed help, I couldn\\'t handle all this on my own. I needed help. I needed a break. I hated how I couldn\\'t find joy in anything. I realized I needed to get help when my son would be crying and i would catch myself raging wanting to punch holes in the walls and screaming at my son. When I finally calmed down after the meltdown I looked at my son and realized what I was becoming. I didn\\'t want to be this way. How could I? My son didn\\'t deserve this. He\\'s just a little baby and here I was being a raging nutcase. \\\\n\\\\nSo here we are. My mom is coming from a few states away to help me with my son. And I have a psychiatrists appointment on Monday. On Tuesday I start medication and therapy. It\\'s been a long road so far but I\\'ve made it this far. Honestly I shouldn\\'t waited this long to seek help but it took my a while to suck in my pride and actually do it. I\\'m still not healed but I can only hope for the best. Wish me luck Reddit! \\\\n\\\\nTl;dr: Had OCD Postpartum Depression, had unrealistic expectations that led to meltdowns, finally seeking professional help.\",\\n            \"stickied\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"postpartumdepression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2tfwf\",\\n            \"thumbnail\": \"self\",\\n            \"title\": \"Sucking in my Pride\",\\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4py3vc/sucking_in_my_pride/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"TegClover\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1423498434,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_l9b19\",\\n            \"created_utc\": 1466083095,\\n            \"domain\": \"self.postpartumdepression\",\\n            \"full_link\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/\",\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"4od9hu\",\\n            \"is_self\": true,\\n            \"locked\": false,\\n            \"media_embed\": {},\\n            \"num_comments\": 0,\\n            \"over_18\": false,\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/\",\\n            \"post_hint\": \"self\",\\n            \"preview\": {\\n                \"images\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"id\": \"AzPHdvhZRXQR8wZaiyHdASf2CJSmMpoDmtNvMYDU1uM\",\\n                        \"resolutions\": [\\n                            {\\n                                \"height\": 154,\\n                                \"url\": \"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=379dddca04416f97ff89d8f8cbda718b\",\\n                                \"width\": 108\\n                            }\\n                        ],\\n                        \"source\": {\\n                            \"height\": 286,\\n                            \"url\": \"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?s=733bbe11f8d829478b31e0eb4b02cb22\",\\n                            \"width\": 200\\n                        },\\n                        \"variants\": {}\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            },\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1472783309,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"secure_media_embed\": {},\\n            \"selftext\": \"Hi all,\\\\n\\\\nI have been practicing a very powerful Qi Gong practice that has healed me from various ailments I once had including depression, social anxiety and low energy levels.

subreddit (that I didn\\'t even know existed, up to, 5 seconds ago) might have some insight that could help.\\\\n \\\\nThe background story:\\\\n \\\\n* So my gf and I are suspect she\\'s suffering from PPD (post-partum depression, amongst other things. Although this has not been officially diagnosed, because she feels the other problems are more important). Part of this mean (isfask) that she has a complete lack of sexual desire, and therefor we have no sex. This used to be very different before: she changed from a high libido and happy girl, into an sad, frustrated, and asexual woman. Our son is nearly 2 years old now, and we haven\\'t had sex for bit longer than that. We only tried 3 times, maximum, which ended in disaster twice, and once a success (until our son wanted attention). We both miss it, and I fear not having it makes everything worse for all parties, and having it back might help her tremendously too. So I would love some help.\\\\n \\\\nThe big question:\\\\n \\\\n* Do any of you have an idea of... what could be done or might be worth a shot?\\\\n \\\\nThanks in advance for any reply.\",\\n

I\\'ve worked on the water for years, always loved the beach and the ocean, and now it just pisses me off to be there and know that I had it, right there, and I gave it up for the nightmare my life feels like now. If anyone knows of a support group out there for fathers in similar situations, or anywhere i can vent and just know that I\\'m not the only one, that I\\'m not crazy or a bad person, please let me know.

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn\\'t have asked for much more.\\\\n\\\\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I\\'m a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I\\'ve always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it\\'s very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don\\'t want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don\\'t.\\\\n\\\\nI also haven\\'t been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I\\'m a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \\\\\"I\\'ll get to it later\\\\\" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It\\'s stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It\\'s stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can\\'t let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can\\'t even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\\\\n\\\\nI also can\\'t sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can\\'t fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I\\'m constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It\\'s frustrating.\\\\n\\\\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\\\\n\\\\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don\\'t know how or what to do.

If this post is rambling it\\'s because I\\'m on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \\\\\"zombie,\\\\\" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn\\'t handle the pressure of, well, anything.\\\\n\\\\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I\\'ve ever felt.\\\\n\\\\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I\\'m glad. I don\\'t have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I\\'m grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\\\\n\\\\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he\\'s busy... NYC based momma...

I\\'m futurecompanion11 and I\\'m 21 weeks pregnant with my first, a baby girl. \\\\n\\\\nFirstly, before my pregnancy I was fairly active and ate a semi-low carb diet. I was running fairly regularly. Then I got pregnant, then I got HG. Hyperemesis Gravidarum made me sick and practically bed ridden for 12/13 weeks. I was barely able to eat any vegetables until 19 weeks along. \\\\n\\\\nBy 8 weeks along I had lost a few pounds. But then I ate away part of the nausea with sugary/carby foods. It was all I could keep down and sugary drinks especially helped curb the nausea. So I started gaining weight. I\\'ve gained 20 pounds from my starting weight and I\\'m not really too happy about it. \\\\n\\\\nAt 20 weeks I started really feeling better so I tried to start eating better and even started swimming and walking/jogging. Jogging or running is pretty hard on me right now. I\\'ve lost a lot of muscle by laying in bed for weeks. Swimming has been great but since I\\'ve been back at work the pool closes at 5 and I don\\'t have time to get there (next week it will be open until 8 though). \\\\n\\\\nThe thing is is sometimes I still struggle with nausea in the mornings and the only thing that really helps it is easily digested carbs and I know that it\\'s putting the weight on me. I can\\'t let my stomach get anywhere near empty or the nausea/heartburn turns really bad. Once I get going during the day I can usually manage to eat healthier but the mornings are rough on me. \\\\n\\\\nSo I guess I\\'m looking for advice. Do I just fight the morning and try to eat a protein breakfast to get myself going through the day? Should I jump into eating healthy and risk feeling sick? Or should I just keep doing what I\\'m doing, gain too much weight, and deal with it after the pregnancy is over?  Has anyone else on here been through HG and then want to get fit again mid pregnancy? Any thoughts or advice is appreciated.

You all inspire me and motivate me on a daily basis, so I figured it might be time for me to contribute to this fabulous community.\\\\n\\\\nAs someone who didn\\'t work out....well, at all....during her first pregnancy, I decided to make the commitment to keep up exercising after I found out that I was pregnant with my second.  I am so glad that I did!  While the physical benefits have been great, I have also found that the psychological benefits are beyond reproach.  Even with a 2-year-old and an even crazier schedule than in my first pregnancy, I feel much more even-keeled emotionally.  It is GREAT. :)\\\\n\\\\nAll of this pregnant-exercisey goodness has lead me to researching fitness during pregnancy quite a bit.  I figured some of you ladies might find some of these links/articles interesting! I tried to limit the studies that I posted here to research done in the last five years.  Sadly, there needs to be a LOT more research done on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, because (as many of these articles notes) cultural perceptions of exercising during pregnancy are only recently starting to shift toward the positive end of the spectrum.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[American College of Sports Medicine Current Comment: Exercise During Pregnancy](https://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/exerciseduringpregnancy.pdf)  A nice summary of the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, that it is actually *recommended* by both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and that women may absolutely continue with current exercise regimens OR begin new ones while pregnant.\\\\n\\\\n[American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable Consensus Statement: Impact of Physical Activity during Pregnancy and Postpartum on Chronic Disease Risk](https://www.acsm.org/docs/publications/Impact%20of%20Physical%20Activity%20during%20Pregnancy%20and%20Postpartum%20on%20Chronic%20Disease%20Risk.pdf?sfvrsn=0) This one was really cool- exercise during pregnancy may actually reduce the risk of preeclampsia, other hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, joint and musculoskeletal pain, and depression in pregnant women. This article also includes a section on the effect of exercise on lactation that was well-substantiated- basically exercise has absolutely no effect on lactation; women who exercise produce just as much boob-juice as women who don\\'t, and the compositions of said milk is exactly the same. (One study did note that \\\\\"exhaustive exercise\\\\\" at \\\\\"maximum intensity\\\\\" decreased certain immunological components of breast milk, though.  But only for about an hour after said exhaustive exercise, then the components of the breast milk return back to normal. AH, the human body is so cool!)  My favorite quote from this article (as a lady who loves to lift heavy and has continued to do so during this pregnancy): \\\\\"fetuses of women who continue vigorous weightbearing exercise until onset of labor have normal amniotic\\\\nfluid erythropoietin levels, fewer worrisome fetal heart\\\\npatterns during labor, and decreased rates of both meconium\\\\nstaining and cord entanglement at birth.\\\\\" Yesssss.\\\\n\\\\n[Post-Partum Exercise: What You Need to Know](http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2014/january/post-partum-exercise-what-you-need-to-know)  This shorty-short little article provided a totally healthy (and do-able!) post-partum exercise schedule based on the age-old \\\\\"9 months to put it on, 9 months to take it off\\\\\" idiom: \\\\\"Months 1 - 3: Emphasis should be on staying healthy and getting back into a routine. Months 4 - 6: Begin concentrating on light weight training and cardio.  Months 7 - 9: Rebuilding strength, and higher intensity cardio.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Exercise in Pregnancy: Effect on Fitness and Obstetric Outcomes\\\\u2014A Randomized Trial](http://bradleypricemd.com/documents/exercise_in_pregnancy.pdf)  This article was published in 2012 and documents the effect of perinatal exercise on women both during and after pregnancy. Highlights from this study: only about 16% of pregnant women exercise the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology-recommended 30 minutes per day.  Not many obstetricians discuss exercise with their patients, and because data on fitness and pregnancy is relatively limited, not many docs in obstetrics programs even receive information on perinatal exercise in school (EEP!!!). Not a single woman who was part of the \\\\\"exercise\\\\\" group in this study developed gestational diabetes.  The lengths of pregnancy and labor in the exercise and non-exercise groups were almost exactly the same, though 87% of women in the exercise group gave birth vaginally, compared to 61% in the sedentary group.  Eight control subjects opted out to exercise rather than to continue in the sedentary group (yaaasss). Placenta weight was slightly higher in the active group, consistent with evidence that exercise augments placental growth during early and mid pregnancy. Aaaaand the last sentence of the paper: **\\\\\"The data are strong enough to suggest that every practicing obstetrician would be wise to provide each newly pregnant woman a prescription for exercise in pregnancy.\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\n[Maternal fitness at the onset of the second trimester of pregnancy: correlates and relationship with infant birth weight](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2047-6310.2012.00129.x/abstract;jsessionid=CAAF08AC388993F57439D6B57D241B2A.f01t04?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) Published in 2013: \\\\\"A positive relationship between maternal muscular fitness and infant birth weight highlighted maternal strength in pregnancy as a new determinant of infant birth weight.\\\\\" Basically, a fit mama tends to result in a higher birth weight in the baby.\\\\n\\\\n[Core Training Exercise Selection During Pregnancy](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2012/02000/Core_Training_Exercise_Selection_During_Pregnancy.9.aspx)  Published in 2012 by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. It killed me that I would have to buy this damn article to read anything but the abstract...I love where it is headed though: \\\\\"Abdominal core and muscular conditioning is seldom recommended for pregnant populations. A literature review clearly indicates support from the medical field for the application of core muscular training during pregnancy to help alleviate many issues associated with pregnancy.

My son was born 2 1/ months early and I lost my first son 6 months into the pregnancy so our life together started out more stressful than most. I can honestly say that going through post partum was almost as bad as what I went through losing my baby. Here I had this perfect little boy who survived prematurity and I wasn\\'t happy, I felt locked inside myself, I couldn\\'t bond and I couldn\\'t talk to anyone because what would they say- \\\\\"be happy you finally have a son...\\\\\" I remember feeling that he deserved so much more, that they would be better off without me. I thought about how peaceful it would be if I drove the 9 hours to Seattle and just kept driving off the pier into the bay, how still the water around me would be and then they wouldn\\'t have to deal with me shut down, irritable, tired. I never thought about hurting him, I thought about chopping down the ponderosa pines in my yard with my hands, I thought about how great it would be if fairy godmothers were real and I could call one, I thought my dead son would be ashamed that I wasn\\'t a vision of smiling maternal bliss like the women in commercials. \\\\n He had colic for 3 months and every night he would cry for hours, the sound was like nails on a chalkboard inside me and I thought he was expressing what wasn\\'t ok for me to express. I couldn\\'t deal with it, I had no family support or any real support from friends, my ex husband would be gone at work all day and I would be home alone trying so hard to feel the joy that I wanted to feel and hating myself every second that I didn\\'t. It wasn\\'t until Brooke Shields appeared on Oprah to talk about her experiences and her book that I understood what I was going through. He was 2 and napping and tears just started pouring down my face, all I could think was that I wasn\\'t bad, it wasn\\'t my fault that all my chemicals were so fucked up, and being able to separate myself from my condition lifted that fog, I felt liberated and now I\\'m ok. \\\\n  It makes me really mad that professionals know how common this and how it can come to a devastating end but since it\\'s a \\\\\"woman\\'s issue\\\\\" no effort is meant to be pro active and preventative about it. No one sits down and explains it to you before it happens, no one checks up on you, when you tell people you feel like a bad mom and you\\'re irritable and you think you made a mistake they say \\\\\"you don\\'t mean it, your\\'e tired\\\\\" . You have to deal with your husband complaining that you\\'re negative and lazy and you should just cheer up....  it\\'s so wrong and unnecessary.

A large proportion of healthy people can have them to an extent as well, but there is a point where they become too real/disturbing/disruptive to be normal. Intrusive obsessional thoughts were a major feature of my postpartum anxiety/depression. They slowly evolved and eventually featured me doing very violent, gruesome things to my son, to the point that I could *feel* myself doing those things (Not saying that yours would get so bad!). That made it hard to talk about, but I went to my psychologist and got referred to a psychiatrist, and I am much better now.\\\\n\\\\nAs for what you do: definitely bring up everything that is bothering you to your primary doctor/care provider. If that is your OB/Gyn, that\\'s ok, but if you have a family doctor, I\\'d go to them instead. Really, go to the person that you feel the most comfortable with talking to this about. After telling your doctor all of your issues/symptoms and life context, the doctor can prescribe medication right away if they feel it is warranted, but my preference would be (if time allows) for you to talk to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist. They are better trained to dissect exactly what is going on in your mind, which makes them better at picking specific antidepressants/anti anxiety medication for your specific issues (if necessary). It will take several weeks to start seeing results with medications (although side effects can start right away, like I had a headache for a week, but it went away). There are multiple medications that are considered safe for breastfeeding, I am on two of them (Wellbutrin and Cipralex). I saw no difference in my son from any passive uptake of the medication into my milk. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my second and they are also generally considered safe for pregnancy (Cat C). I am weaning off now as I have completed my treatment cycle.\\\\n\\\\nTalk therapy has also been very helpful for me, and I strongly recommend it. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I had been seeing the psychologist for a few years before I had my son, as I had pre-existing issues and the cognitive-behavioral therapy was very helpful in those, and the issues related to postpartum anxiety/depression. I\\'d recommend looking into some form of therapy whether or not you go forward with medication, as it can help you in other ways, such as figuring out the sources of these thoughts, identifying other symptoms you didn\\'t realize you had, and other stresses in your life that you might not realize you are not coping well with.\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1427729644,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"cpvl75t\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_30rooj\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_30rooj\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 44328,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1432097627,\\n            \"score\": 3,\\n            \"score_hidden\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"Postpartum_Depression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_31ndt\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"BadgerMama\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1423016342,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_l55ar\",\\n            \"body\": \"Oh my goodness, no wonder you are having issues.

You are drowning in some deep waters and you still manage to feed, change, clothe and feed the baby. That is HUGE. GOOD MAMA. And good for you for reaching out to get help. I know it isn\\'t easy, and sometimes it feels like when you do ask for help, your voice is not really heard or understood. Keep going. Just keep on, I know it feels like you are hanging on by a thread, but yes -- go get that medicine now! My primary care physician hooked me up and gave me a referral to someone who is currently managing my meds. (I ended up finding my best-ever therapist in the same practice as Medicine Woman, so yay for that.) It took me several tries to find the right therapist, too, and I think that I wasted a bit too much time sticking with the ones that didn\\'t work out. (Story of my life.) When I met my current therapist, we clicked, and it just... worked, in a way it had not before. Of course, it helped that she was actually trained and had real degrees in this stuff. \\\\n\\\\nBefore her, I saw a \\\\\"therapist\\\\\" with a doctorate in philosophy first. Useless bugger. Then I saw a woman who was with a therapy practice, but she herself was not a fully trained and licensed psychiatrist, just a \\\\\"therapist.\\\\\" What was the difference? In my case, the two \\\\\"misses\\\\\" both saw me for months without once figuring out that the symptoms that I was complaining about might be indicative of PPD. With the second one, I actually got on the medication while in therapy with her, and she kept forgetting I was on the medication, and when I reminded her of it, she was always a bit confused and dismissive, as if it could not have possibly been a problem with my brain chemistry. \\\\n\\\\nThe third one knew exactly what I was talking about with the PPD stuff. She LISTENED to me, made me feel like I was being heard and understood, and seemed like she was fully supportive of me as an individual. Like she really saw me for who I was and wanted me to thrive. I truly hope you find someone who is like that for you. Now, please, get some sleep if you can (I know it can be so hard to come by, but I hope you can!) and promise you will make it a big priority to talk to a doctor about getting that medication. \\\\n\\\\nIs there any way you can talk to a school counselor about your situation? You may have some options there. With an 8-month-old, you are in THE roughest stretch, and even being able to put school on hold until fall will make a huge difference. Do you have *any* support at all?\\\\n\\\\n(Sorry for the TL:dr, I did not know I was going to write a novel!)\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1426465973,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"cpg3f8t\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_2yrf8s\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 3,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t1_cpg0bzl\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 5932,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1427782408,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"score_hidden\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"Postpartum_Depression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_31ndt\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"BadgerMama\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1423016342,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_l55ar\",\\n            \"body\": \"(Background: I am 40, have had depression issues my whole life, but I completely fell apart when my second child was born in 2011. My PPD manifested as intense rage. It sucked.)\\\\n\\\\nZoloft saved my life. Nothing else except medication got me back to a place where I was functional again. I tried everything I could and went undiagnosed and untreated and unhappy and scared for 18 months. The day I found out I had PPD and that I could be treated, I cried with relief. I had reached the point where each day I struggled to decide if my children would be better off without me. If this would be the day that I either killed myself or ran away. (And yes, it was precisely in that order.) The baby was safe, but my oldest was 3 at the time, and there were times I would shut him in the bathroom and order him not to come out (while I hit/threw/broke things) just so I could be sure I wouldn\\'t hurt him.\\\\n\\\\nZoloft was a miracle. The very first day I started, I could feel a difference. (Your mileage may vary.) I am also seeing a therapist. There are still days when I feel the depression creeping back. There are still days when I get angry. But I no longer feel like my depression is a monster that is controlling me. I feel like I have the power to make choices now, and that is a HUGE difference.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m sorry I don\\'t have much help for you. My therapist has told me of some women who (for one reason or other) cannot take any medication, and they made it through a combination of daily meditation, daily exercise, regular talk-therapy, etc. I don\\'t know if that will help you, but if you can manage it and haven\\'t tried already, it may be worth a shot. Also, one thing I have noticed is that if I do not get enough sleep, all of my PPD symptoms get out of control really fast, even with the medication. So now I am trying to be much much better about getting enough sleep. Another mom I know with PPD said she got out for a walk every day, and that helped her.\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1426430800,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"cpfl4o7\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_2yrf8s\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_2yrf8s\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 296636,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1427773696,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"score_hidden\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"Postpartum_Depression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_31ndt\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"bandaidaddict\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1269234935,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_3ybq3\",\\n            \"body\": \"So, I hope you see this.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can\\'t breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give. I guess this is my intro for now. I look forward to some redditt support as I try and sort this out. \",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1412308374,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"ckz304w\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_29uv4j\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_29uv4j\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 7797758,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1426707622,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"score_hidden\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"Postpartum_Depression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_31ndt\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"bumblebeerose\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1326870781,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_6oz0x\",\\n            \"body\": \"Going through this right now and it really hits home, I wasn\\'t aware of how common or debilitating postnatal depression and anxiety was until I searched for stories of other women.\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1408727603,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"cjxlsfk\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_2e8vgh\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_2e8vgh\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 48775,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1427408167,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"score_hidden\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"Postpartum_Depression\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_31ndt\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"darapixie\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1322686444,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_6cflw\",\\n            \"body\": \"I\\'ve been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that triggered the PND.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can\\'t breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give. I guess this is my intro for now.

I move less weight this way but I like being able to keep benching.  I do incline sometimes too and that feels OK. \\\\n\\\\nFor squats, I started doing maybe 85-90% my usual weight in the third trimester and paid close attention to how my joints felt and to my form.  Around 16 weeks I started using a Smith machine for squats. I take a wider stance now and the machine makes adjusting my form each week much easier.

I took the entire first trimester off. I was exhausted.\\\\n\\\\nI started running again in the second trimester. It was hard to run a mile. I would go out for a 5k, but it would be run/walk. At first. Within a week, my endurance was coming back and I was able to run the entire 5k. Within a few weeks, I was running 6-10 miles each time I went out.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m 31 weeks tomorrow and haven\\'t run for almost three weeks now. Around 26 or 27 weeks, running got much more difficult. More tiring. I was struggling with 5k again, but it wasn\\'t improving. But from 14ish weeks to 26 weeks, I was running 20+ miles a week and it felt GOOD. 26-28 weeks, I went out, but didn\\'t generally feel good during the run, and had pelvic pain afterwards.\\\\n\\\\nSo my experience with restarting running was that I regained a lot of my stamina very quickly - within a couple of weeks. I\\'m sad now that I haven\\'t run in three weeks and I\\'ve been contemplating going out again (having motivation problems). But I\\'m really glad I kept at it during the second trimester - I felt great.\\\\n\\\\nI did gain 15 pounds during the second trimester, which felt like a lot (total by the end of second trimester was up 20.6 pounds, which is more than I\\'ve gained in my prior two pregnancies). But it\\'s all belly - I\\'ve also kept track of my belly, butt, and thigh measurements. Belly was up almost ten inches (around), butt was 0-1 inches (my measurement for 15 weeks is the same as my measurement for 27 weeks, but 15 weeks was 1 inch more than 14 weeks), and thigh was up .25-1 inch (goes up and down).\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1461934667,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"d2lzyi0\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_4gqiyf\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_4gqiyf\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 144682,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1463771311,\\n            \"score\": 1,\\n            \"stickied\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"fitpregnancy\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_372t2\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"virtuesplea\",\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"body\": \"I started getting foot pain around that point.

I was able to switch back to the original shoes after a few weeks.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as speed, I encountered a similar slowdown. I figured as long as I was getting out there, it was better than sitting in the house.\\\\n\\\\nI did stop running at about 28 weeks (I\\'m 30 now). I\\'d like to go back out, but it was getting harder and harder to run - instead of 10 miles, I was doing 3 or so, with a couple minute break to stretch in the middle.

I\\'ve been scaling back weights and intensity since I found out, at about 6w.  I just go by feel.  If you\\'re working with a coach, definitely let them know.  Number one thing is to check with your doctor and make sure you\\'re cleared to get back in the gym, since you were on bedrest!!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you do start back, remember that your workouts are no longer for time or for PRs.  No running/rowing time trials, no max lifts, no trying to beat benchmarks.  It does not matter what anyone else is doing, don\\'t let yourself compete against them (this is really hard for me, as I was competitive in CF pre-pg).  Stay hydrated, keep intensity moderate (you should be able to hold a conversation), and scale weights as you feel you\\'re able.  I\\'m typically working off about 80% of my pre-pregnancy maxes now, at 15w, but every day is different - some days lifting feels terrible, some days it almost feels normal.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, I stopped doing bar muscle-ups (sad face! I love those!) and GHD work as soon as I found out.  I\\'m now finding that some other things involving hollow body position (hollow holds, ring muscle-ups, kipping pullups) often don\\'t feel good due to the round ligament pain I have, so if it hurts that day I find a substitute movement for the WOD.  I will probably stop situps and bench press in about another month or so (around 20w), and start doing cleans/snatches from the hang instead of from the ground.  I still do everything else.  I was a gymnast, so inverted movements for me personally are still safe; however, if I ever feel like my balance is compromised, I will stop those as well.  Some days I choose intermediate-level WODs instead of Rx-level like I\\'m used to, just depends on how I\\'m feeling.  As bad as it sounds, this is really humbling for me, more than anything - I have to set my Crossfitter\\'s ego aside for the year! LOL\\\\n\\\\nOne last thing.  As long as you\\'re medically cleared and you\\'re working out safely (keeping the above things in mind), don\\'t let other people tell you that you shouldn\\'t be Crossfitting while pregnant!  There is no better time to stay in shape, doing the things your body is used to doing.  I\\'ve had to field that concern already from multiple people (well-meaning, but misguided), and it\\'s aggravating to me that people think Crossfit is suddenly dangerous when a women is pregnant! \\\\n\\\\nThe Crossfit Mom blog is no longer around, but their poster can be found here http://crossfitcaveman.com/crossfit-during-pregnancy/ with super helpful info on scaling.

If you are of a healthy weight and habits, now is a good time to calculate your caloric needs and make it a goal to maintain those for the first trimester.

Their tracking is great, and there\\'s a great sub on there for gaining weight. One caveat -- do some research on basal metabolic rate and put in your own calorie value, because MFP tends to vastly underestimate how much women need to eat, especially for women who work out. \\\\n\\\\nI have two thoughts of my own here. First, are you getting any kind of treatment or doing anything to address your anxiety? 5 months out isn\\'t too far out for PPD to show up, and it can manifest as anxious or OCD tendencies, not just depression. It sounds like it\\'s starting to interfere with your self-care, so I think it\\'s probably time to talk about it with your doctor.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, I think liquid calories are going to be your friend right now. Yes, they\\'ll be high carb, but getting something down is important and I suspect keeping milk, juices, etc around will be easier than taking the time to prepare whole meals. Even when you\\'re not hungry, maybe you can sneak in some calories that way.\",\\n            \"controversiality\": 0,\\n            \"created_utc\": 1445007709,\\n            \"distinguished\": null,\\n            \"gilded\": 0,\\n            \"id\": \"cw1vzu3\",\\n            \"link_id\": \"t3_3ozodm\",\\n            \"nest_level\": 1,\\n            \"parent_id\": \"t3_3ozodm\",\\n            \"reply_delay\": 3711,\\n            \"retrieved_on\": 1447006628,\\n            \"score\": 8,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"fitpregnancy\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_372t2\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"author\": \"auryngem\",\\n            \"author_created_utc\": 1338187906,\\n            \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\\n            \"author_flair_text\": null,\\n            \"author_fullname\": \"t2_7tuip\",\\n            \"body\": \"Thanks for your thoughts.

On top of that my husband had to go back to our home state to take care of some family business, so I am alone with our little one, the dogs, and the house cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nI am so stressed out between keeping her happy, trying to get myself fed so I can feed her, taking the dogs out and trying to give them attention but failing so bad, trying to get my shower in w/o her screaming bloody murder.\\\\n\\\\nI was diagnosed with PPD 2 weeks after I had her. After being on Zoloft for 2 months my insurance dropped me and I had to go off cold turkey..that was an interesting ride to say the least. I think I am doing ok.. but when I really think about it I feel like I am drowning, overwhelmed, feeling so along, and starting to shut myself in. But I don't want to bother my husband because he is so busy with his Grandpa dying up North and when he is home he is always so tired from work when he gets home I just don't want to complain because I am a SAHM/W, going to school, cleaning the house, and making sure dinner is on the table when he gets home. So I don't have it bad at all... but I just feel so empty..\\\\n\\\\nI miss my friends, sister-in-law, and brother. I just miss having people there for me because down here it is just over the phone and that doesn't help at all.\\\\n\\\\nHe wont' be home for 1week and 3 days... and the longer he is gone the more I feel like I am going underwater.. it doesn't' help that he has been short with me on the phone the past 2 times I have talked with him. I pretend to be strong and that suck so much energy out of me and actually makes it worse.\\\\n\\\\nO and I learned to day via sister-in-law that his mom isn't doing good mentally and I have all this info but not allowed to tell him... that is getting to me.\\\\n\\\\nI am doing a mommy and me thing tomorrow.. and on the 19 because I am going to be alone for Easter which will be hard because I am big on family holiday. Even though my mom stresses me out to no end she is my mom and I love her. And I have to do her 4 month shots alone, which I am hoping I can get through without crying like a crazy women, but it is not a good outlook. I had such issues with her appointments that I shut down and had my husband take over because I felt so bad I couldn't do anything in the moment to help her; I just couldn't deal. But I will have to on the date.\\\\n\\\\nI guess I just needed to vent... or as my husband says sometimes having my pity party.. It sucks also because I don't want to move back to our home state because there is nothing there for us but dysfunctional family and drinking.. so nothing good.\\\\n\\\\nO and when I put her in the carseat she cries all the time... we even bought a new seat didn't. I even read the post on here or /r/Mommit[1] about what to do. The window trick helps just a little but it is so stressful to go anywhere..\\\\n\\\\nAlso I just need a hug and to be held.. my husband has been so sore lately when he is home to cuddle. which is something I need but he doesn't understand and says we cuddle in bed.. that is not the same.\\\\n\\\\nI also miss running but I am not going to start again until she is 6 months or so because I am afraid I will loose my milk.. might be over reacting but I just can't get over that.\\\\n\\\\nI also feel like telling my husband what about me? I know you are busy with your Grandpa but I need some attention from you a nice phone call or a nice text.. I had being put on the back burner completely. I mean I am not asking to talk with him every second of the day but I do need a hey I love you and was thinking of you kind of thing once in awhile.\\\\n\\\\nThank you for reading my woes/pity party/sad issues I feel are big deals which might not be.

I pretend to be strong and that suck so much energy out of me and actually makes it worse.\\\\n\\\\nO and I learned to day via sister-in-law that his mom isn't doing good mentally and I have all this info but not allowed to tell him... that is getting to me.\\\\n\\\\nI am doing a mommy and me thing tomorrow.. and on the 19 because I am going to be alone for Easter which will be hard because I am big on family holiday. Even though my mom stresses me out to no end she is my mom and I love her. And I have to do her 4 month shots alone, which I am hoping I can get through without crying like a crazy women, but it is not a good outlook. I had such issues with her appointments that I shut down and had my husband take over because I felt so bad I couldn't do anything in the moment to help her; I just couldn't deal. But I will have to on the date.\\\\n\\\\nI guess I just needed to vent... or as my husband says sometimes having my pity party.. It sucks also because I don't want to move back to our home state because there is nothing there for us but dysfunctional family and drinking.. so nothing good.\\\\n\\\\nO and when I put her in the carseat she cries all the time... we even bought a new seat didn't. I even read the post on here or /r/Mommit[1] about what to do. The window trick helps just a little but it is so stressful to go anywhere..\\\\n\\\\nAlso I just need a hug and to be held.. my husband has been so sore lately when he is home to cuddle. which is something I need but he doesn't understand and says we cuddle in bed.. that is not the same.\\\\n\\\\nI also miss running but I am not going to start again until she is 6 months or so because I am afraid I will loose my milk.. might be over reacting but I just can't get over that.\\\\n\\\\nI also feel like telling my husband what about me? I know you are busy with your Grandpa but I need some attention from you a nice phone call or a nice text.. I had being put on the back burner completely. I mean I am not asking to talk with him every second of the day but I do need a hey I love you and was thinking of you kind of thing once in awhile.\\\\n\\\\nThank you for reading my woes/pity party/sad issues I feel are big deals which might not be. And yes it could always be worse, and someone is always having a worse day then me but this is bad for me.\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"postpartumdepression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_2tfwf\\\",\\n            \\\"thumbnail\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"This is hard!

As a first time mom learning the ropes of parenting has been a tough endeavor that I couldn't even imagine during pregnancy. It's hard to imagine something so beautiful in its own right can lead to something that made me recognize my limits, and reveal something underlining that lead to me getting treatment for Postpartum Depression. \\\\n\\\\nBack story: After a rather difficult pregnancy my son was born on March 4th. Labor and delivery went pretty much how you can imagine it going. I had contractions for thirty six hours and I pushed for about two. I delivered my son at 12:45 a.m. and I was so eager to hold him and look at him. My family and I was in tears seeing this little bundle of joy come to life. I remember looking at him and wanting to provide the best I could as any parent would want for their child. \\\\n\\\\nMy husband took about a week and a half off for the maternity leave. It went by so fast I remember him going to work that day and I was so nervous because now I was on own. I didn't really have visitors as I'm rather introverted so everything kind of fell on me if I wanted anything done. I had unrealistic expectations having the house chores done which was the first major sign of the Postpartum Depression. I would only sleep about three hours during the night and when I woke up for feedings and I couldn't go back to sleep. After my son was fast asleep I would spend the next few hours cleaning. Everything had to be perfect but the problem was it wasn't ever good enough. I wanted to show that I had everything in control even though it wasn't like I had tons of visitors. Another sign was I had a hard time eating. At around two months I was struggling to eat at least once a day. The problem with all of this was I had so much built up energy I didn't feel tired or hungry. I just wanted to do everything all at once and keep doing these tedious, ridiculous routines. If something didn't get done I would have this anxiety attack that I wasn't being a good mom and my son deserved to have me be perfect all the time. I had a lot of trouble going outside for more then an hour because i didn't know to handle taking care of son while we were out and about. I dreaded the idea of having to feed him outside the house for some reason. I felt like a failure if i didn't read his hunger cues in time, or if he started crying. I also had these strange fears that I imagined myself dropping my son, or if I was walking down the hallway I would scrap his head on the wall or wack his head on the door frame. It was like little delusions something bad would happen.\\\\n\\\\nBy this time all of this stuff kind of wrapped itself into a giant mess of major depression. I wasn't the mom I wanted to be since I couldn't hold my expectations of chores and projects. I felt like I wasn't as bonded to my son as i should have been. I wasn't taking care of myself at all. \\\\n\\\\nI had my six week postpartum appointment at eight weeks postpartum and told my ob/gyn doctor about all of what was happening. I was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression and anxiety. I was put on birth control and a antidepressant called Lexapro. I was so hopeful this would be all that I needed and looked forward to getting everything on track. \\\\n\\\\nOver a few weeks it got to the point were all the stress lead me to dreading waking up or I would have meltdowns that would lead to me getting angry with my son. At this time I was crying all the time but I was ashamed to bring it up to my husband that the antidepressant wasn't working. I didn't know what to do since I no longer had Medicaid. I couldn't imagine having to get a hefty hospital bill to go back to my doctor. So once I finished the Lexapro I hoped i could handle getting better by myself. Just relax, go outside, really do anything distract myself for the depression. It didn't work as you can imagine and about a week ago I had a huge meltdown and felt like running away from all of this. I told my husband I needed help, I couldn't handle all this on my own. I needed help. I needed a break. I hated how I couldn't find joy in anything. I realized I needed to get help when my son would be crying and i would catch myself raging wanting to punch holes in the walls and screaming at my son. When I finally calmed down after the meltdown I looked at my son and realized what I was becoming. I didn't want to be this way. How could I? My son didn't deserve this. He's just a little baby and here I was being a raging nutcase. \\\\n\\\\nSo here we are. My mom is coming from a few states away to help me with my son. And I have a psychiatrists appointment on Monday. On Tuesday I start medication and therapy. It's been a long road so far but I've made it this far. Honestly I shouldn't waited this long to seek help but it took my a while to suck in my pride and actually do it. I'm still not healed but I can only hope for the best. Wish me luck Reddit! \\\\n\\\\nTl;dr: Had OCD Postpartum Depression, had unrealistic expectations that led to meltdowns, finally seeking professional help.\\\",\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"postpartumdepression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_2tfwf\\\",\\n            \\\"thumbnail\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Sucking in my Pride\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4py3vc/sucking_in_my_pride/\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"TegClover\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1423498434,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_l9b19\\\",\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1466083095,\\n            \\\"domain\\\": \\\"self.postpartumdepression\\\",\\n            \\\"full_link\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/\\\",\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"4od9hu\\\",\\n            \\\"is_self\\\": true,\\n            \\\"locked\\\": false,\\n            \\\"media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"num_comments\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"over_18\\\": false,\\n            \\\"permalink\\\": \\\"/r/postpartumdepression/comments/4od9hu/a_very_powerful_qi_gong_practice_for_improved/\\\",\\n            \\\"post_hint\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"preview\\\": {\\n                \\\"images\\\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"id\\\": \\\"AzPHdvhZRXQR8wZaiyHdASf2CJSmMpoDmtNvMYDU1uM\\\",\\n                        \\\"resolutions\\\": [\\n                            {\\n                                \\\"height\\\": 154,\\n                                \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=379dddca04416f97ff89d8f8cbda718b\\\",\\n                                \\\"width\\\": 108\\n                            }\\n                        ],\\n                        \\\"source\\\": {\\n                            \\\"height\\\": 286,\\n                            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na-kdjPLfAOIUG8VRlpB45268qm50QYj1_Hh3Ad6YYo.jpg?s=733bbe11f8d829478b31e0eb4b02cb22\\\",\\n                            \\\"width\\\": 200\\n                        },\\n                        \\\"variants\\\": {}\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            },\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1472783309,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"secure_media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"selftext\\\": \\\"Hi all,\\\\n\\\\nI have been practicing a very powerful Qi Gong practice that has healed me from various ailments I once had including depression, social anxiety and low energy levels.

I didn't even know existed, up to, 5 seconds ago) might have some insight that could help.\\\\n \\\\nThe background story:\\\\n \\\\n* So my gf and I are suspect she's suffering from PPD (post-partum depression, amongst other things. Although this has not been officially diagnosed, because she feels the other problems are more important). Part of this mean (isfask) that she has a complete lack of sexual desire, and therefor we have no sex. This used to be very different before: she changed from a high libido and happy girl, into an sad, frustrated, and asexual woman. Our son is nearly 2 years old now, and we haven't had sex for bit longer than that. We only tried 3 times, maximum, which ended in disaster twice, and once a success (until our son wanted attention). We both miss it, and I fear not having it makes everything worse for all parties, and having it back might help her tremendously too. So I would love some help.\\\\n \\\\nThe big question:\\\\n \\\\n* Do any of you have an idea of... what could be done or might be worth a shot?\\\\n \\\\nThanks in advance for any reply.\\\",\\n

I have suffered from depression in the past and have been on Prozac, which has been very helpful, but went off this when I became pregnant.  I love my son very much but I feel so trapped, sad, and scared.  I often feel that I have a heavy weight on my chest, have a very upset stomach, don't want to eat, feel like the walls are closing in, and just want to cry.  I am so scared that my life will never be enjoyable again and that I will forever be in a cycle of just trying to survive.  I spoke to my ob about this today and she put me back on Prozac, but I am very afraid that this will not work as it seems like too simple a fix for such awful feelings.  Any suggestions for how to get through this?  \\\",\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"postpartumdepression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_2tfwf\\\",\\n            \\\"thumbnail\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Struggling\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/3rpt00/struggling/\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"torotorolittledog\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1358292043,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_a8q1u\\\",\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1440424283,\\n            \\\"domain\\\": \\\"self.postpartumdepression\\\",\\n            \\\"full_link\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/comments/3i79ti/all_or_nothing/\\\",\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"3i79ti\\\",\\n            \\\"is_self\\\": true,\\n            \\\"media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"num_comments\\\": 2,\\n            \\\"over_18\\\": false,\\n            \\\"permalink\\\": \\\"/r/postpartumdepression/comments/3i79ti/all_or_nothing/\\\",\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1440527709,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"secure_media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"selftext\\\": \\\"Did you find ppd was an all or nothing thing for you?

I don't feel like I have post-partum depression; I don't have any thoughts of harming myself or baby, I don't find it particularly difficult to take care of myself or him. But I don't feel a lot of joy, or fierce devotion, either.\\\\nWhen he babbles, laughs or smiles, it warms my heart, and when he cries, I feel the urgent need to soothe him. The thought of him being hurt or sick breaks my heart. And yet, underneath it all is a degree of indifference to him being in my life at all. I don't relate to the parents who say they can't imagine life without their baby. I can, and in many ways, I miss that life. If you gave me the choice today of just letting someone else raise my son for a little while, I might say yes.\\\\nI know there are thousands of people who would do anything to have a happy, healthy baby of their own, and I feel like a heartless, thankless shrew for feeling this way.\\\\nHave any of you felt this way?

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\\\\n\\\\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\\\\n\\\\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \\\\\\\"I'll get to it later\\\\\\\" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\\\\n\\\\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\\\\n\\\\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\\\\n\\\\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

Since my son was born, 3 weeks ago, I've been really down. I can't stop crying and feeling overwhelmed. Then...when I feel overwhelmed, I get mad and upset with myself because I feel like a terrible mother for feeling that way. When he cries, I feel like I'm having a panic attack and can't handle it.\\\\n\\\\nI have the absolute best husband and support from him. He helps me at night, takes him when I feel overwhelmed, and generally just wants me happy again. The sad part is that I've been such a jerk to him, unintentionally, because I've been so upset. \\\\n\\\\nNow I know that I haven't gotten much sleep. With my son being only 3 weeks old, sleep is rare. I went to see a doctor today about it and she told me that they classify anything up until 6 weeks \\\\\\\"Baby Blues\\\\\\\". Now my question is...would I feel that way with baby blues? Or is it something more? She had me take a questionnaire that has to do with PPD, and said I scored well above a 10.

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\\\\n\\\\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\\\\n\\\\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \\\\\\\"I'll get to it later\\\\\\\" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\\\\n\\\\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\\\\n\\\\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\\\\n\\\\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \\\\\\\"zombie,\\\\\\\" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.\\\\n\\\\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.\\\\n\\\\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\\\\n\\\\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks...

When he cries, I feel like I'm having a panic attack and can't handle it.\\\\n\\\\nI have the absolute best husband and support from him.

My wife and I just had twin boys, and two months in I am more miserable and angry and frustrated than I've ever been in my life, and I've never been a really happy person. I go to sleep at 8pm, get up at 2am, and it feels like a nightmare from the minute I get out of bed until the minute I fall asleep, if I sleep at all. Just hearing a sound out of either kid sets my teeth on edge, I find myself consumed with such an unreasonable hatred that it scares me. I completely understand that they're babies, have no control over their world, no way to communicate other than crying. Logically, everything they do makes perfect sense, the reflux, the gagging, the gas, the crying, the sleep issues. But I cant change the waves of rage and frustration that I feel like are constantly eroding my sanity. My wife is blissfully happy, so I'm trying to let her get out, let her hold on to that happiness, so at least one of us is sane. When I leave the house, I'm just consumed with regret and thoughts of how life was before these two showed up. Of all the things I've willingly given up, nothing is pleasurable anymore. I've worked on the water for years, always loved the beach and the ocean, and now it just pisses me off to be there and know that I had it, right there, and I gave it up for the nightmare my life feels like now. If anyone knows of a support group out there for fathers in similar situations, or anywhere i can vent and just know that I'm not the only one, that I'm not crazy or a bad person, please let me know.

All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\\\\n\\\\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).\\\\n\\\\nI'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again.

Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.\\\\n\\\\nBut for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.\\\\n\\\\nI also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a \\\\\\\"I'll get to it later\\\\\\\" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.\\\\n\\\\nI also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.\\\\n\\\\nWe also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?\\\\n\\\\nThank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a \\\\\\\"zombie,\\\\\\\" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.\\\\n\\\\nThen I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.\\\\n\\\\nI love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.\\\\n\\\\nSorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).\\\\n\\\\nI'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again.

I just did some light (didn't feel so light!!!) weights at home and am looking forward to the gym tomorrow!\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, just wanted to introduce myself as I will be 'round these parts pretty often for the next months :) any other ladies in my situation?\\\\n\\\\nHello!\\\",\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\",\\n            \\\"thumbnail\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Finally got OK to exercise today!!!\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/3awavi/finally_got_ok_to_exercise_today/\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"futurecompanion11\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1342342883,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_8c5rb\\\",\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1433278981,\\n            \\\"domain\\\": \\\"self.fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"full_link\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/389x58/intro_and_struggling_this_pregnancy/\\\",\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"389x58\\\",\\n            \\\"is_self\\\": true,\\n            \\\"media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"num_comments\\\": 8,\\n            \\\"over_18\\\": false,\\n            \\\"permalink\\\": \\\"/r/fitpregnancy/comments/389x58/intro_and_struggling_this_pregnancy/\\\",\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1440696889,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 3,\\n            \\\"secure_media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"selftext\\\": \\\"Hi everyone! I'm futurecompanion11 and I'm 21 weeks pregnant with my first, a baby girl. \\\\n\\\\nFirstly, before my pregnancy I was fairly active and ate a semi-low carb diet. I was running fairly regularly. Then I got pregnant, then I got HG. Hyperemesis Gravidarum made me sick and practically bed ridden for 12/13 weeks. I was barely able to eat any vegetables until 19 weeks along. \\\\n\\\\nBy 8 weeks along I had lost a few pounds. But then I ate away part of the nausea with sugary/carby foods. It was all I could keep down and sugary drinks especially helped curb the nausea. So I started gaining weight. I've gained 20 pounds from my starting weight and I'm not really too happy about it. \\\\n\\\\nAt 20 weeks I started really feeling better so I tried to start eating better and even started swimming and walking/jogging. Jogging or running is pretty hard on me right now. I've lost a lot of muscle by laying in bed for weeks. Swimming has been great but since I've been back at work the pool closes at 5 and I don't have time to get there (next week it will be open until 8 though). \\\\n\\\\nThe thing is is sometimes I still struggle with nausea in the mornings and the only thing that really helps it is easily digested carbs and I know that it's putting the weight on me. I can't let my stomach get anywhere near empty or the nausea/heartburn turns really bad. Once I get going during the day I can usually manage to eat healthier but the mornings are rough on me. \\\\n\\\\nSo I guess I'm looking for advice. Do I just fight the morning and try to eat a protein breakfast to get myself going through the day? Should I jump into eating healthy and risk feeling sick? Or should I just keep doing what I'm doing, gain too much weight, and deal with it after the pregnancy is over?  Has anyone else on here been through HG and then want to get fit again mid pregnancy? Any thoughts or advice is appreciated. Thanks!\\\",\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\",\\n            \\\"thumbnail\\\": \\\"self\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Intro and Struggling this pregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/389x58/intro_and_struggling_this_pregnancy/\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"Bnewhook\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1413895475,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_iz2fm\\\",\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1426886877,\\n            \\\"domain\\\": \\\"self.fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"full_link\\\": \\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/2zqs2l/just_bought_a_double_jogging_stroller/\\\",\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"2zqs2l\\\",\\n            \\\"is_self\\\": true,\\n            \\\"media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"num_comments\\\": 2,\\n            \\\"over_18\\\": false,\\n            \\\"permalink\\\": \\\"/r/fitpregnancy/comments/2zqs2l/just_bought_a_double_jogging_stroller/\\\",\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1440842146,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 9,\\n            \\\"secure_media_embed\\\": {},\\n            \\\"selftext\\\": \\\"I have been agonizing over buying another jogging stroller since I found out I was pregnant!

Why am I so slow now? \\\\nMy pace has gone from 5:15 Kms to 7min Kms!!! (that's 8:15 to 11 min plus for you yanks) \\\\n\\\\nI'm 10w today and I'm fucking exhausted after a 12 k run. I used to bust at least 18-25 km on Sundays, and had no problem maintaining 50-60km weeks. That feels impossible now. I'm hoping after 12 weeks I can start creeping my mileage back up a bit more. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2) Im registered for a 1/2 marathon on March 4. Considering my current sad mileage I'm considering a walk/run strategy.  Not to race just to complete the distance. Is this a bad idea. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3) I'm registered for a 30k race early April   Also plan to walk run depending on feeling. Is this a bad idea ? These races were booked as marathon prep before I was with child. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI understand you are supposed to play it by ear and not do anything that feels wrong or hurts. But running is the only joy I had and now it's gone. Now it sucks and is a slog and I fucking miss it so bad. Oh boo hoo for me.

I'm still hitting 3 or 4 workouts a week but now that the hotter weather has come in, I'm starting to worry more about overheating and potentially harming the baby. When I'm doing strength/weightlifting I don't really get that hot but cardio *(circuits class is my usual thing)* kicks my ass. I try to take more rests and I drink LOTS of water. \\\\n\\\\n* How worried should I be? How do you decide when it's too much and when it's okay to keep going?\\\\n\\\\nBefore I got pregnant I was eating &amp; tracking daily and sticking to 1,500-1,600 cals. I asked the midwife at my first appointment about what to do and she just give me some wishy-washy advice about eating healthy foods and not to worry about it. I just wanted her to give me a target to hit, tracking is/was such a large part of my life and I've kinda gone off the rails since I stopped. I'm allowing myself to eat comfort foods and just be lazy. I lost a good amount of weight before pregnancy and I want to do what I can to limit any gains but I struggle with knowing how much I should be eating. \\\\n\\\\n* Did anyone track pre-pregnancy? How did you handle the switch? Do you still track? \\\\n\\\\nAb work - I've been avoiding exercises that have me lying on my front because I already find it uncomfortable (like back extensions) but I'm still doing planks, leg raises etc. Not sure when I should drop these from my routine.

You all inspire me and motivate me on a daily basis, so I figured it might be time for me to contribute to this fabulous community.\\\\n\\\\nAs someone who didn't work out....well, at all....during her first pregnancy, I decided to make the commitment to keep up exercising after I found out that I was pregnant with my second.  I am so glad that I did!  While the physical benefits have been great, I have also found that the psychological benefits are beyond reproach.  Even with a 2-year-old and an even crazier schedule than in my first pregnancy, I feel much more even-keeled emotionally.  It is GREAT. :)\\\\n\\\\nAll of this pregnant-exercisey goodness has lead me to researching fitness during pregnancy quite a bit.  I figured some of you ladies might find some of these links/articles interesting! I tried to limit the studies that I posted here to research done in the last five years.  Sadly, there needs to be a LOT more research done on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, because (as many of these articles notes) cultural perceptions of exercising during pregnancy are only recently starting to shift toward the positive end of the spectrum.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[American College of Sports Medicine Current Comment: Exercise During Pregnancy](https://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/exerciseduringpregnancy.pdf)  A nice summary of the benefits of exercise during pregnancy, that it is actually *recommended* by both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and that women may absolutely continue with current exercise regimens OR begin new ones while pregnant.\\\\n\\\\n[American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable Consensus Statement: Impact of Physical Activity during Pregnancy and Postpartum on Chronic Disease Risk](https://www.acsm.org/docs/publications/Impact%20of%20Physical%20Activity%20during%20Pregnancy%20and%20Postpartum%20on%20Chronic%20Disease%20Risk.pdf?sfvrsn=0) This one was really cool- exercise during pregnancy may actually reduce the risk of preeclampsia, other hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, joint and musculoskeletal pain, and depression in pregnant women. This article also includes a section on the effect of exercise on lactation that was well-substantiated- basically exercise has absolutely no effect on lactation; women who exercise produce just as much boob-juice as women who don't, and the compositions of said milk is exactly the same. (One study did note that \\\\\\\"exhaustive exercise\\\\\\\" at \\\\\\\"maximum intensity\\\\\\\" decreased certain immunological components of breast milk, though.  But only for about an hour after said exhaustive exercise, then the components of the breast milk return back to normal. AH, the human body is so cool!)  My favorite quote from this article (as a lady who loves to lift heavy and has continued to do so during this pregnancy): \\\\\\\"fetuses of women who continue vigorous weightbearing exercise until onset of labor have normal amniotic\\\\nfluid erythropoietin levels, fewer worrisome fetal heart\\\\npatterns during labor, and decreased rates of both meconium\\\\nstaining and cord entanglement at birth.\\\\\\\" Yesssss.\\\\n\\\\n[Post-Partum Exercise: What You Need to Know](http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2014/january/post-partum-exercise-what-you-need-to-know)  This shorty-short little article provided a totally healthy (and do-able!) post-partum exercise schedule based on the age-old \\\\\\\"9 months to put it on, 9 months to take it off\\\\\\\" idiom: \\\\\\\"Months 1 - 3: Emphasis should be on staying healthy and getting back into a routine. Months 4 - 6: Begin concentrating on light weight training and cardio.  Months 7 - 9: Rebuilding strength, and higher intensity cardio.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Exercise in Pregnancy: Effect on Fitness and Obstetric Outcomes\\\\u2014A Randomized Trial](http://bradleypricemd.com/documents/exercise_in_pregnancy.pdf)  This article was published in 2012 and documents the effect of perinatal exercise on women both during and after pregnancy. Highlights from this study: only about 16% of pregnant women exercise the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology-recommended 30 minutes per day.  Not many obstetricians discuss exercise with their patients, and because data on fitness and pregnancy is relatively limited, not many docs in obstetrics programs even receive information on perinatal exercise in school (EEP!!!). Not a single woman who was part of the \\\\\\\"exercise\\\\\\\" group in this study developed gestational diabetes.  The lengths of pregnancy and labor in the exercise and non-exercise groups were almost exactly the same, though 87% of women in the exercise group gave birth vaginally, compared to 61% in the sedentary group.  Eight control subjects opted out to exercise rather than to continue in the sedentary group (yaaasss). Placenta weight was slightly higher in the active group, consistent with evidence that exercise augments placental growth during early and mid pregnancy. Aaaaand the last sentence of the paper: **\\\\\\\"The data are strong enough to suggest that every practicing obstetrician would be wise to provide each newly pregnant woman a prescription for exercise in pregnancy.\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\n[Maternal fitness at the onset of the second trimester of pregnancy: correlates and relationship with infant birth weight](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2047-6310.2012.00129.x/abstract;jsessionid=CAAF08AC388993F57439D6B57D241B2A.f01t04?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) Published in 2013: \\\\\\\"A positive relationship between maternal muscular fitness and infant birth weight highlighted maternal strength in pregnancy as a new determinant of infant birth weight.\\\\\\\" Basically, a fit mama tends to result in a higher birth weight in the baby.\\\\n\\\\n[Core Training Exercise Selection During Pregnancy](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2012/02000/Core_Training_Exercise_Selection_During_Pregnancy.9.aspx)  Published in 2012 by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. It killed me that I would have to buy this damn article to read anything but the abstract...I love where it is headed though: \\\\\\\"Abdominal core and muscular conditioning is seldom recommended for pregnant populations.

Currently at 7w1d.

Unfortunately, during my week of waiting, I was depressed eating... and now that the pregnancy is still on, I NEED TO TAKE CONTROL! Since finding out, I've quit drinking, smoking cigarettes and weed, and working to find a good plan to start incorporating better habits, both pre- and post-natal.\\\\n\\\\nI'm quite out of shape from where I once was, I have PCOS, slight hypo, and currently weigh around 230lbs in a 5\\\\\\\"4\\\\\\\" frame. I never used to be like this... but now I'm praying to make a change, to make sure this little bean stays healthy and that this momma stays far, far away from gestational diabetes. I need to lose weight, but in a healthy way - as well as needing to start moving.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are some great websites to look into for someone who isn't 'healthy' and 'fit'... yet? Everything I see pertains to people who are already leading active lifestyles.\\\\n\\\\nI've looked into the following prenatal DVD's, any experience with these?

My son was born 2 1/ months early and I lost my first son 6 months into the pregnancy so our life together started out more stressful than most. I can honestly say that going through post partum was almost as bad as what I went through losing my baby. Here I had this perfect little boy who survived prematurity and I wasn't happy, I felt locked inside myself, I couldn't bond and I couldn't talk to anyone because what would they say- \\\\\\\"be happy you finally have a son...\\\\\\\" I remember feeling that he deserved so much more, that they would be better off without me. I thought about how peaceful it would be if I drove the 9 hours to Seattle and just kept driving off the pier into the bay, how still the water around me would be and then they wouldn't have to deal with me shut down, irritable, tired. I never thought about hurting him, I thought about chopping down the ponderosa pines in my yard with my hands, I thought about how great it would be if fairy godmothers were real and I could call one, I thought my dead son would be ashamed that I wasn't a vision of smiling maternal bliss like the women in commercials. \\\\n He had colic for 3 months and every night he would cry for hours, the sound was like nails on a chalkboard inside me and I thought he was expressing what wasn't ok for me to express. I couldn't deal with it, I had no family support or any real support from friends, my ex husband would be gone at work all day and I would be home alone trying so hard to feel the joy that I wanted to feel and hating myself every second that I didn't. It wasn't until Brooke Shields appeared on Oprah to talk about her experiences and her book that I understood what I was going through. He was 2 and napping and tears just started pouring down my face, all I could think was that I wasn't bad, it wasn't my fault that all my chemicals were so fucked up, and being able to separate myself from my condition lifted that fog, I felt liberated and now I'm ok. \\\\n  It makes me really mad that professionals know how common this and how it can come to a devastating end but since it's a \\\\\\\"woman's issue\\\\\\\" no effort is meant to be pro active and preventative about it. No one sits down and explains it to you before it happens, no one checks up on you, when you tell people you feel like a bad mom and you're irritable and you think you made a mistake they say \\\\\\\"you don't mean it, your'e tired\\\\\\\" . You have to deal with your husband complaining that you're negative and lazy and you should just cheer up....  it's so wrong and unnecessary.

Because of the biting it felt appropriate to start weaning when I did. Lo did not seem to mind at all and I think was ready.

A large proportion of healthy people can have them to an extent as well, but there is a point where they become too real/disturbing/disruptive to be normal. Intrusive obsessional thoughts were a major feature of my postpartum anxiety/depression. They slowly evolved and eventually featured me doing very violent, gruesome things to my son, to the point that I could *feel* myself doing those things (Not saying that yours would get so bad!). That made it hard to talk about, but I went to my psychologist and got referred to a psychiatrist, and I am much better now.\\\\n\\\\nAs for what you do: definitely bring up everything that is bothering you to your primary doctor/care provider. If that is your OB/Gyn, that's ok, but if you have a family doctor, I'd go to them instead. Really, go to the person that you feel the most comfortable with talking to this about. After telling your doctor all of your issues/symptoms and life context, the doctor can prescribe medication right away if they feel it is warranted, but my preference would be (if time allows) for you to talk to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist. They are better trained to dissect exactly what is going on in your mind, which makes them better at picking specific antidepressants/anti anxiety medication for your specific issues (if necessary). It will take several weeks to start seeing results with medications (although side effects can start right away, like I had a headache for a week, but it went away). There are multiple medications that are considered safe for breastfeeding, I am on two of them (Wellbutrin and Cipralex). I saw no difference in my son from any passive uptake of the medication into my milk. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my second and they are also generally considered safe for pregnancy (Cat C). I am weaning off now as I have completed my treatment cycle.\\\\n\\\\nTalk therapy has also been very helpful for me, and I strongly recommend it. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I had been seeing the psychologist for a few years before I had my son, as I had pre-existing issues and the cognitive-behavioral therapy was very helpful in those, and the issues related to postpartum anxiety/depression. I'd recommend looking into some form of therapy whether or not you go forward with medication, as it can help you in other ways, such as figuring out the sources of these thoughts, identifying other symptoms you didn't realize you had, and other stresses in your life that you might not realize you are not coping well with.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1427729644,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cpvl75t\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_30rooj\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_30rooj\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 44328,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1432097627,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 3,\\n            \\\"score_hidden\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"Postpartum_Depression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_31ndt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"BadgerMama\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1423016342,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_l55ar\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Oh my goodness, no wonder you are having issues. That is a hell of a lot of stress and pressure you are under! It would be enough to knock anyone back a bit, PPD or no! And yes, you definitely do need some help (she said, stating the obvious). Are you breastfeeding? I ask because I didn't get PPD with my firstborn, BUT when he weaned, I got hit with some major depression issues...suicidal thoughts, etc. It was pure yuck. Since you are going back to work and have so much on your plate, just wanted to toss that warning your way. There is no end to the hormonal s***storm that postpartum moms get to deal with. \\\\n\\\\nNow, that being said, BIG props to you for doing the basics. You are drowning in some deep waters and you still manage to feed, change, clothe and feed the baby. That is HUGE. GOOD MAMA. And good for you for reaching out to get help. I know it isn't easy, and sometimes it feels like when you do ask for help, your voice is not really heard or understood. Keep going. Just keep on, I know it feels like you are hanging on by a thread, but yes -- go get that medicine now! My primary care physician hooked me up and gave me a referral to someone who is currently managing my meds. (I ended up finding my best-ever therapist in the same practice as Medicine Woman, so yay for that.) It took me several tries to find the right therapist, too, and I think that I wasted a bit too much time sticking with the ones that didn't work out. (Story of my life.) When I met my current therapist, we clicked, and it just... worked, in a way it had not before. Of course, it helped that she was actually trained and had real degrees in this stuff. \\\\n\\\\nBefore her, I saw a \\\\\\\"therapist\\\\\\\" with a doctorate in philosophy first. Useless bugger. Then I saw a woman who was with a therapy practice, but she herself was not a fully trained and licensed psychiatrist, just a \\\\\\\"therapist.\\\\\\\" What was the difference? In my case, the two \\\\\\\"misses\\\\\\\" both saw me for months without once figuring out that the symptoms that I was complaining about might be indicative of PPD. With the second one, I actually got on the medication while in therapy with her, and she kept forgetting I was on the medication, and when I reminded her of it, she was always a bit confused and dismissive, as if it could not have possibly been a problem with my brain chemistry. \\\\n\\\\nThe third one knew exactly what I was talking about with the PPD stuff. She LISTENED to me, made me feel like I was being heard and understood, and seemed like she was fully supportive of me as an individual. Like she really saw me for who I was and wanted me to thrive. I truly hope you find someone who is like that for you.

You may have some options there. With an 8-month-old, you are in THE roughest stretch, and even being able to put school on hold until fall will make a huge difference.

My PPD manifested as intense rage. It sucked.)\\\\n\\\\nZoloft saved my life. Nothing else except medication got me back to a place where I was functional again. I tried everything I could and went undiagnosed and untreated and unhappy and scared for 18 months. The day I found out I had PPD and that I could be treated, I cried with relief. I had reached the point where each day I struggled to decide if my children would be better off without me. If this would be the day that I either killed myself or ran away. (And yes, it was precisely in that order.) The baby was safe, but my oldest was 3 at the time, and there were times I would shut him in the bathroom and order him not to come out (while I hit/threw/broke things) just so I could be sure I wouldn't hurt him.\\\\n\\\\nZoloft was a miracle. The very first day I started, I could feel a difference. (Your mileage may vary.) I am also seeing a therapist. There are still days when I feel the depression creeping back. There are still days when I get angry. But I no longer feel like my depression is a monster that is controlling me. I feel like I have the power to make choices now, and that is a HUGE difference.\\\\n\\\\nI'm sorry I don't have much help for you. My therapist has told me of some women who (for one reason or other) cannot take any medication, and they made it through a combination of daily meditation, daily exercise, regular talk-therapy, etc. I don't know if that will help you, but if you can manage it and haven't tried already, it may be worth a shot. Also, one thing I have noticed is that if I do not get enough sleep, all of my PPD symptoms get out of control really fast, even with the medication. So now I am trying to be much much better about getting enough sleep. Another mom I know with PPD said she got out for a walk every day, and that helped her.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1426430800,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cpfl4o7\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_2yrf8s\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_2yrf8s\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 296636,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1427773696,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"score_hidden\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"Postpartum_Depression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_31ndt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"bandaidaddict\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1269234935,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_3ybq3\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"So, I hope you see this. I just found this subreddit and it looks like it doesn't get much traffic unfortunately. I feel like we are going through the exact same thing. I don't want to go on meds either. I've been on meds and hate what they do to me. Did you end up going to therapy? Did it help? I feel like I should've done it years ago, but I've always been nervous. I feel like I've battled this anxiety/depression for so many years and I was finally coping, then I had a kid. I have regressed so much. It helps to see that others are going through the same thing.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can't breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give. I guess this is my intro for now. I look forward to some redditt support as I try and sort this out. \\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1412308374,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"ckz304w\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_29uv4j\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_29uv4j\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 7797758,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1426707622,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"score_hidden\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"Postpartum_Depression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_31ndt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"bumblebeerose\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1326870781,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_6oz0x\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Going through this right now and it really hits home, I wasn't aware of how common or debilitating postnatal depression and anxiety was until I searched for stories of other women.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1408727603,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cjxlsfk\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_2e8vgh\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_2e8vgh\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 48775,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1427408167,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"score_hidden\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"Postpartum_Depression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_31ndt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"darapixie\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1322686444,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_6cflw\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"I've been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that triggered the PND.

I was only diagnosed when my LO Katherine was 13 months.  I am now 5 months into my treatment.  It's a tough rocky road so far and a lot of childhood trauma has come up so I'm dealing with all at once.  Counselling is the key to getting better along with medication.  It's tough, but it will get better.  When I have very low times I think about why I am doing this healing and it's for Katherine, for her to have a strong mother figure in her life that can be there to help her when she needs it.  When I think like that I keep pushing myself.  The road back to you is full of hills and valleys but as long as you are on the road you are in the process of getting back to feeling like you again.

Have a wonderful 5 month old baby and I am 34. I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. Very carefully weaned off my meds prior to trying to conceive. Stayed in good spirits all through pregnancy. Then the month before my baby was born my cat was hit by a car. The week before my baby was born my 14 year old dog passed away. I never went into labor, my water just broke. I had to be started on pitocin. I was so determined to have a drug free birth I just endured the pain. Honestly it was a little traumatizing. After we came home from the hospital I began having massive panic attacks every evening between 6 and 8 pm. By the fourth night I began having panic attacks due to fear of the approaching attack. I called the doctor and he prescribed a strong antihistamine to help me stay calm and sleep. The idea was that it was safe for breastfeeding. However one of the side effects was that it started to dry me up. I made the choice to stop taking it and just tough it out. My son had feeding issues so I pumped. At 2 months he began nursing. Being able to nurse my son is such a bright spot for me, such a success and now I feel like I am faced with a choice. I have been depressed for over a month. I am struggling to cope with work and feel down all the time. I am trying to be strong and mindful but am frequently overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I know I need to start back on the medication I was taking before I conceived. Doing so means I can't breastfeed. I was so careful during my pregnancy to be drug free and am trying so hard now. There are drugs supposedly safe while breastfeeding but I wonder what kind of long term research has really been done. I am thinking about trying therapy. I probably will. Something has to give. I guess this is my intro for now. I look forward to some redditt support as I try and sort this out. \\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1412308374,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"ckz304w\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_29uv4j\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_29uv4j\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 7797758,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1426707622,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"score_hidden\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"Postpartum_Depression\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_31ndt\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"hambot\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1279563915,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_47098\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"She should talk to a doctor about this, either her OBGYN or a counselor/therapist to see if this is postpartum depression.

Maybe one or two workouts I felt too tired to do my usual routine so on those days I would do a warm up, recognize that I felt tired and call it a day. Always keeping in mind that I would try again the next workout. \\\\n\\\\nAround 16 weeks bench press got uncomfortable so I started doing it with my feet up on the bench. I move less weight this way but I like being able to keep benching.  I do incline sometimes too and that feels OK. \\\\n\\\\nFor squats, I started doing maybe 85-90% my usual weight in the third trimester and paid close attention to how my joints felt and to my form.  Around 16 weeks I started using a Smith machine for squats. I take a wider stance now and the machine makes adjusting my form each week much easier. It also helps me cope with my changing center of gravity.\\\\n\\\\nUntil last week I was doing deadlifts at about 80-85%. My stomach is finally big enough that my usual form just doesn't work (I can't squat deep enough to grab the bar without widening my stance). So I decided no more deadlifts for now. I'm kinda bummed about that but then happy that I was able to do them for this long. \\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1468646359,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d5e9lfc\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4rwqsw\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_4rwqsw\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 636909,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1471463514,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"chefymum\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1409620146,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_i6d8d\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Everyone is different so there are no hard and fast rules.

By then the size of your belly is probably the most limiting factor. \\\\n\\\\nI'm also a believer in only doing low impact cardio while pregnant--mostly for my own comfort (my joints don't like the extra weight) and piece of mind. Biking is fine as long as you are careful about falling, as someone else said your center of gravity shifts so consider that you might not be as graceful as you were pre-pregnancy, plus, your butt and lady parts might not be so happy with you after longer rides (a lesson learned from experience). My best friend at 35 weeks for cardio is the elliptical, but I know my SIL really enjoyed swimming laps (she got sciatica with her third)\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, just be realistic and don't push yourself unnecessarily. It's only 10 months of your life and while it's great to do what you can to maintain what you have, you can focus on progressing after the kid is born.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1468526150,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d5cdyka\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4sv1ac\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_4sv1ac\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 2659,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1471430965,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 2,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"likeflyingakite\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1435669861,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_ofwi1\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"I've gained too much weight for someone with my BMI (in the obese range) during this pregnancy but my doctor said it was fine and they would be way more worried if I lost weight then adding too much.

I'm 9 weeks along now and hopefully this first trimester slump will scale back so I can keep at it. :)\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1452527956,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cyu4csh\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_405nqm\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_405nqm\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 197925,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1454420483,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"lentil5\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1302985267,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_5444z\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise-During-Pregnancy-and-the-Postpartum-Period\\\\nI know it's not evidence against but they aren't going to give carte Blanche recommendations like this unless it's safe. These are the official recommendations on exercise in pregnancy. If you have a healthy pregnancy, lift as heavy as you like. Your Nurse Practitioner has outdated information.\\\\n\\\\nI usually lift heavy but pregnancy has knocked me around. I'm still lifting at 28 weeks but it's at around 50% of my max and I nixed the snatches and cleans around end of first trimester due to balance issues. Listen to your body and be prepared to scale back even more dramatically if you need to! Saddest part for me is that squatting is starting to give me some nasty hip pain so I'm modifying as necessary. Baby is happy and kicking away in there. She likes the loud music at the gym :) \\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1450275665,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cy0zxgb\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_3x2k3d\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_3x2k3d\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 8019,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1451677232,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 2,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"Lorenzo_Canyon\\\",\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Lol. Good luck with that. Your abdominal muscles for sure are at risk since they separate during pregnancy, could result in a hernia. I would just back off on lifting heavy weights. Just like you're not supposed to drink or eat raw fish while pregnant, a lot of times they can't pinpoint why because you can't test the hypothesis on pregnant women, they just understand the possibilities of what CAN happen. But I guess just worry about what you want to do since you're the only person you have to worry about, right? Not like you're growing a human inside you or anything...whatever makes you happy. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEdit: Lifting heavy weight can induce premature labor and cause low birth weight. \\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1450270414,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"edited\\\": 1450270762,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cy0xroj\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_3x2k3d\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 3,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t1_cy0xl7b\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 548,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1451676214,\\n            \\\"score\\\": -10,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"Apocalypte\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1216655481,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_377vl\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"In the UK if you are low risk then pretty much all your care is automatically with midwives, more complicated cases are with OB-GYNs.

I got to yoga maybe 3 times in the first trimester but have been going at least once a week since then. \\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1467211316,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d4sl0cg\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4qb6rf\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 2,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t1_d4s4c9s\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 40391,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1469374257,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 3,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"GeneralAugusto\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1449502522,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_sqxd8\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Good for you!

I took the entire first trimester off. I was exhausted.\\\\n\\\\nI started running again in the second trimester. It was hard to run a mile. I would go out for a 5k, but it would be run/walk. At first. Within a week, my endurance was coming back and I was able to run the entire 5k. Within a few weeks, I was running 6-10 miles each time I went out.\\\\n\\\\nI'm 31 weeks tomorrow and haven't run for almost three weeks now. Around 26 or 27 weeks, running got much more difficult. More tiring. I was struggling with 5k again, but it wasn't improving. But from 14ish weeks to 26 weeks, I was running 20+ miles a week and it felt GOOD. 26-28 weeks, I went out, but didn't generally feel good during the run, and had pelvic pain afterwards.\\\\n\\\\nSo my experience with restarting running was that I regained a lot of my stamina very quickly - within a couple of weeks. I'm sad now that I haven't run in three weeks and I've been contemplating going out again (having motivation problems). But I'm really glad I kept at it during the second trimester - I felt great.\\\\n\\\\nI did gain 15 pounds during the second trimester, which felt like a lot (total by the end of second trimester was up 20.6 pounds, which is more than I've gained in my prior two pregnancies). But it's all belly - I've also kept track of my belly, butt, and thigh measurements. Belly was up almost ten inches (around), butt was 0-1 inches (my measurement for 15 weeks is the same as my measurement for 27 weeks, but 15 weeks was 1 inch more than 14 weeks), and thigh was up .25-1 inch (goes up and down).\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1461934667,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d2lzyi0\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4gqiyf\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_4gqiyf\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 144682,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1463771311,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"virtuesplea\\\",\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"I started getting foot pain around that point. I switched to a more minimalist shoe (I have flat feet and overpronate also) - the shoes I had been running in had a little bit of arch support, and the pain I was having was on the outside of my feet. Switching a less support allowed me to more easily correct how my foot was striking. I was able to switch back to the original shoes after a few weeks.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as speed, I encountered a similar slowdown. I figured as long as I was getting out there, it was better than sitting in the house.\\\\n\\\\nI did stop running at about 28 weeks (I'm 30 now). I'd like to go back out, but it was getting harder and harder to run - instead of 10 miles, I was doing 3 or so, with a couple minute break to stretch in the middle. That was discouraging, and I haven't found the motivation to get back out since.\\\\n\\\\nFor the shin splits, heel walks have prevented them for me.

I continued to run a few days a week despite being tired and lacking motivation. Running when I wasn't too exhausted (but still tired) helped with my energy and helped with my nausea.

I've been scaling back weights and intensity since I found out, at about 6w.  I just go by feel.  If you're working with a coach, definitely let them know.  Number one thing is to check with your doctor and make sure you're cleared to get back in the gym, since you were on bedrest!!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you do start back, remember that your workouts are no longer for time or for PRs.  No running/rowing time trials, no max lifts, no trying to beat benchmarks.  It does not matter what anyone else is doing, don't let yourself compete against them (this is really hard for me, as I was competitive in CF pre-pg).  Stay hydrated, keep intensity moderate (you should be able to hold a conversation), and scale weights as you feel you're able.  I'm typically working off about 80% of my pre-pregnancy maxes now, at 15w, but every day is different - some days lifting feels terrible, some days it almost feels normal.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, I stopped doing bar muscle-ups (sad face! I love those!) and GHD work as soon as I found out.  I'm now finding that some other things involving hollow body position (hollow holds, ring muscle-ups, kipping pullups) often don't feel good due to the round ligament pain I have, so if it hurts that day I find a substitute movement for the WOD.  I will probably stop situps and bench press in about another month or so (around 20w), and start doing cleans/snatches from the hang instead of from the ground.  I still do everything else.  I was a gymnast, so inverted movements for me personally are still safe; however, if I ever feel like my balance is compromised, I will stop those as well.  Some days I choose intermediate-level WODs instead of Rx-level like I'm used to, just depends on how I'm feeling.  As bad as it sounds, this is really humbling for me, more than anything - I have to set my Crossfitter's ego aside for the year! LOL\\\\n\\\\nOne last thing.  As long as you're medically cleared and you're working out safely (keeping the above things in mind), don't let other people tell you that you shouldn't be Crossfitting while pregnant!  There is no better time to stay in shape, doing the things your body is used to doing.  I've had to field that concern already from multiple people (well-meaning, but misguided), and it's aggravating to me that people think Crossfit is suddenly dangerous when a women is pregnant! \\\\n\\\\nThe Crossfit Mom blog is no longer around, but their poster can be found here http://crossfitcaveman.com/crossfit-during-pregnancy/ with super helpful info on scaling.

At first. Within a week, my endurance was coming back and I was able to run the entire 5k. Within a few weeks, I was running 6-10 miles each time I went out.\\\\n\\\\nI'm 31 weeks tomorrow and haven't run for almost three weeks now. Around 26 or 27 weeks, running got much more difficult. More tiring. I was struggling with 5k again, but it wasn't improving. But from 14ish weeks to 26 weeks, I was running 20+ miles a week and it felt GOOD. 26-28 weeks, I went out, but didn't generally feel good during the run, and had pelvic pain afterwards.\\\\n\\\\nSo my experience with restarting running was that I regained a lot of my stamina very quickly - within a couple of weeks. I'm sad now that I haven't run in three weeks and I've been contemplating going out again (having motivation problems).

Belly was up almost ten inches (around), butt was 0-1 inches (my measurement for 15 weeks is the same as my measurement for 27 weeks, but 15 weeks was 1 inch more than 14 weeks), and thigh was up .25-1 inch (goes up and down).\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1461934667,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d2lzyi0\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4gqiyf\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_4gqiyf\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 144682,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1463771311,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"Thatwasunpleasant\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1360466414,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_ajj54\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"I've seen examples of women who had GD AND were obese lose weight during pregnancy because of watching their food intake closely. My goal for the first trimester was to not gain any weight (my BMI was just barely in the overweigbt range, sad about that) and I monitored my calories closely to make sure I didn't. It is okay to not gain weight in your first trimester. You aren't supposed to increase calorie consumption yet as the baby is so small it doesn't require the additional calories. If you are of a healthy weight and habits, now is a good time to calculate your caloric needs and make it a goal to maintain those for the first trimester. Before the naysayers jump in, it is okay to gain 3-5lbs in the first tri. Also, water-weight can be a bitch, so don't freak out over every lb (like I do still) because you may see some wild fluctuations that your eating can't account for.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1461131682,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"d2a005g\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_4flt58\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_4flt58\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 2800,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1463564777,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 4,\\n            \\\"stickied\\\": false,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"jules0072\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1334597766,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_7gz82\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"I just got all teary.

Their tracking is great, and there's a great sub on there for gaining weight. One caveat -- do some research on basal metabolic rate and put in your own calorie value, because MFP tends to vastly underestimate how much women need to eat, especially for women who work out. \\\\n\\\\nI have two thoughts of my own here. First, are you getting any kind of treatment or doing anything to address your anxiety? 5 months out isn't too far out for PPD to show up, and it can manifest as anxious or OCD tendencies, not just depression. It sounds like it's starting to interfere with your self-care, so I think it's probably time to talk about it with your doctor.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, I think liquid calories are going to be your friend right now. Yes, they'll be high carb, but getting something down is important and I suspect keeping milk, juices, etc around will be easier than taking the time to prepare whole meals. Even when you're not hungry, maybe you can sneak in some calories that way.\\\",\\n            \\\"controversiality\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"created_utc\\\": 1445007709,\\n            \\\"distinguished\\\": null,\\n            \\\"gilded\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"id\\\": \\\"cw1vzu3\\\",\\n            \\\"link_id\\\": \\\"t3_3ozodm\\\",\\n            \\\"nest_level\\\": 1,\\n            \\\"parent_id\\\": \\\"t3_3ozodm\\\",\\n            \\\"reply_delay\\\": 3711,\\n            \\\"retrieved_on\\\": 1447006628,\\n            \\\"score\\\": 8,\\n            \\\"subreddit\\\": \\\"fitpregnancy\\\",\\n            \\\"subreddit_id\\\": \\\"t5_372t2\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"author\\\": \\\"auryngem\\\",\\n            \\\"author_created_utc\\\": 1338187906,\\n            \\\"author_flair_css_class\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_flair_text\\\": null,\\n            \\\"author_fullname\\\": \\\"t2_7tuip\\\",\\n            \\\"body\\\": \\\"Thanks for your thoughts. Am am still lifting and prd some deadlifts last week 110kg and my front squats, when I think about it it was probably on implantation day. This makes me feel a little better.

I was told by my OB last pregnancy I am high risk for post and ante natal depression - if lifting goes I worry this will be inevitable. He suggested then seeing someone while I was well, I just didn't quite make it to that point. I will make sure to do so this time. It's good to hear from someone who has been/is in my position and is making it work. Your reassurance means a lot.
